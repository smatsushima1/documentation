# Create new repo from command line

```
echo "# test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin [REPO]
git push -u origin master
```

---

# Push an existing repo

```
git remote add origin [REPO]
git push -u origin master
```

---

# Reading submodules from cloned repos

Submodules within clones repos wont be readable until they are ininitialized:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

---

# Working with same-name submodules

If one were to create and initialize a submodule, remove it, then create another submodule with the same name, the data from the former submodule will reinitialize with the latter submodule. Reversing this simply entitles the user to remove the former submodules 'private' files and credentials from the ```.gitmodules``` directory:

```
cd [REPO]
vim .gitmodules
    # delete all lines pointing to the submod
git submodule deinit [SUBMODULE_IN_QUESTION]
cd .git
cd modules
rm -rf [SUBMODULE_IN_QUESTION]
```

The submod must then be removed from the main repo:

```
cd [REPO]
rm -rf [SUBMODULE_IN_QUESTION]
```

At this point, the correct submod can be added to the main repo with no overlapping issues.

# Pushing a file too large

The maximum file size git can commit is 100 Mb. Pushing a file larger than that will forevor save it in the commit history and the system will always try to re-push it even after it has been deleted. The following error message will forevor haunt the user:

```

# Removing file from commit history

```
git reset [previous SHA]
[Do your changes]
git commit -am [message]
git push -f
```

```
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch [PATH_TO_FILE]' HEAD
```

The specific path to the file from the directory is required. This path is relative from the repo page, not the home computer directory:

```
# this will not work since it references the home directory:
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch /home/[USER]/[REPO]/[REPO_FOLDER]/[FILE]' HEAD

# this will work
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch [REPO_FOLDER]/[FILE]' HEAD
```

Comparison of the wrong and right paths are as follows:

```
# wrong path with just the file name
[User@localhost home]$ git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch collectionFile' HEAD
Rewrite 7f19bbc7da2062fd0cc1486810f01c0bb614b25b (14/14)
WARNING: Ref 'refs/heads/master' is unchanged

# right path with the file name in the correct directory
[User@localhost home]$ git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch data_wrangling_bootcamp/chuck_scripts/collectionFile' HEAD
Rewrite 7e298e55c3c390c5a31a08fef68b8b538067b9c1 (13/14)rm 'data_wrangling_bootcamp/chuck_scripts/collectionFile'
Rewrite 7f19bbc7da2062fd0cc1486810f01c0bb614b25b (14/14)
Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten
```

After succesfully removing the file from the commit history, all this is needed is a ```git commit -m [MESSAGE]``` and ```git push```. The full procedure is below:

```
git add [FILE]
git commit -m '[MESSAGE]'
git push
    # didnt realize file was too large
git rm [FILE]
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch [PATH_TO_FILE]' HEAD
git commit -m '[MESSAGE]'
git push
```

Sample code for the whole process is as follows:

```
[User@localhost test]$ cp ~/Downloads/large_file .

# Alternative: erasing commit history

An alternative way that essentially erases the git commit history is to delete the ```.git``` folder within the main repo page then re-initializing and re-configuring it:

```
rm -rf .git/
git init
git add .
git commit -m '[TEXT]'
git remote add [REPO] [REPO_URL_FROM_CLONE]
git checkout master
git push -u --force [REPO] [BRANCH]
```

The actual instance of the code for the above is as follows:

```
[User@localhost home]$ rm -rf .git/
[User@localhost home]$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/User/git/home/.git/
[User@localhost home]$ git add .
[User@localhost home]$ git commit -m 'Delete .git, then git init'

It is imperative to note that the above step will erase the commit history. The ```git log``` action only shows one value instead of the many that were there before - meaning that there will be no previous commits to reference if trying to revert to an older version of the commit history. For this reason, this method isnt recommended unless absolutely necessary.
