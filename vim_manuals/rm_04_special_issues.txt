==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*print-intro*

On MS-Windows Vim can print your text on any installed printer.  On other
systems a PostScript file is produced.  This can be directly sent to a
PostScript printer.  For other printers a program like ghostscript needs to be
used.

Note: If you have problems printing with |:hardcopy|, an alternative is to use
|:TOhtml| and print the resulting html file from a browser.

					*:ha* *:hardcopy* *E237* *E238* *E324*
:[range]ha[rdcopy][!] [arguments]
			Send [range] lines (default whole file) to the
			printer.

			On MS-Windows a dialog is displayed to allow selection
			of printer, paper size etc.  To skip the dialog, use
			the [!].  In this case the printer defined by
			'printdevice' is used, or, if 'printdevice' is empty,
			the system default printer.

			For systems other than MS-Windows, PostScript is
			written in a temp file and 'printexpr' is used to
			actually print it.  Then [arguments] can be used by
			'printexpr' through |v:cmdarg|.  Otherwise [arguments]
			is ignored.  'printoptions' can be used to specify
			paper size, duplex, etc.

:[range]ha[rdcopy][!] >{filename}
			As above, but write the resulting PostScript in file
			{filename}.
			Things like "%" are expanded |cmdline-special|
			Careful: An existing file is silently overwritten.
			{only available when compiled with the |+postscript|
			feature}
			On MS-Windows use the "print to file" feature of the
			printer driver.

Progress is displayed during printing as a page number and a percentage.  To
abort printing use the interrupt key (CTRL-C or, on MS-systems, CTRL-Break).

Printer output is controlled by the 'printfont' and 'printoptions' options.
'printheader' specifies the format of a page header.

The printed file is always limited to the selected margins, irrespective of
the current window's 'wrap' or 'linebreak' settings.  The "wrap" item in
'printoptions' can be used to switch wrapping off.
The current highlighting colors are used in the printout, with the following
considerations:
1) The normal background is always rendered as white (i.e. blank paper).
2) White text or the default foreground is rendered as black, so that it shows
   up!
3) If 'background' is "dark", then the colours are darkened to compensate for
   the fact that otherwise they would be too bright to show up clearly on
   white paper.

==============================================================================
2. Print options					*print-options*

Here are the details for the options that change the way printing is done.
For generic info about setting options see |options.txt|.

							*pdev-option*
'printdevice' 'pdev'	string	(default empty)
			global
This defines the name of the printer to be used when the |:hardcopy| command
is issued with a bang (!) to skip the printer selection dialog.  On Win32, it
should be the printer name exactly as it appears in the standard printer
dialog.
If the option is empty, then vim will use the system default printer for
":hardcopy!"

							*penc-option* *E620*
'printencoding' 'penc'	String	(default empty, except for:
					Windows, OS/2: cp1252,
					Macintosh: mac-roman,
					VMS: dec-mcs,
					HPUX: hp-roman8,
					EBCDIC: ebcdic-uk)
			global
Sets the character encoding used when printing.  This option tells Vim which
print character encoding file from the "print" directory in 'runtimepath' to
use.

This option will accept any value from |encoding-names|.  Any recognized names
are converted to Vim standard names - see 'encoding' for more details.  Names
not recognized by Vim will just be converted to lower case and underscores
replaced with '-' signs.

If 'printencoding' is empty or Vim cannot find the file then it will use
'encoding' (if Vim is compiled with |+multi_byte| and it is set an 8-bit
encoding) to find the print character encoding file.  If Vim is unable to find
a character encoding file then it will use the "latin1" print character
encoding file.

When 'encoding' is set to a multi-byte encoding, Vim will try to convert
characters to the printing encoding for printing (if 'printencoding' is empty
then the conversion will be to latin1).  Conversion to a printing encoding
other than latin1 will require Vim to be compiled with the |+iconv| feature.
If no conversion is possible then printing will fail.  Any characters that
cannot be converted will be replaced with upside down question marks.

Four print character encoding files are provided to support default Mac, VMS,
HPUX, and EBCDIC character encodings and are used by default on these
platforms.  Code page 1252 print character encoding is used by default on
Windows and OS/2 platforms.

							*pexpr-option*
'printexpr' 'pexpr'	String	(default: see below)
			global
Expression that is evaluated to print the PostScript produced with
|:hardcopy|.
The file name to be printed is in |v:fname_in|.
The arguments to the ":hardcopy" command are in |v:cmdarg|.
The expression must take care of deleting the file after printing it.
When there is an error, the expression must return a non-zero number.
If there is no error, return zero or an empty string.
The default for non MS-Windows or VMS systems is to simply use "lpr" to print
the file: >

    system('lpr' . (&printdevice == '' ? '' : ' -P' . &printdevice)
	. ' ' . v:fname_in) . delete(v:fname_in) + v:shell_error

On MS-Dos, MS-Windows and OS/2 machines the default is to copy the file to the
currently specified printdevice: >

    system('copy' . ' ' . v:fname_in . (&printdevice == ''
		? ' LPT1:' : (' \"' . &printdevice . '\"')))
		. delete(v:fname_in)

On VMS machines the default is to send the file to either the default or
currently specified printdevice: >

    system('print' . (&printdevice == '' ? '' : ' /queue=' .
		&printdevice) . ' ' . v:fname_in) . delete(v:fname_in)

If you change this option, using a function is an easy way to avoid having to
escape all the spaces.  Example: >

	:set printexpr=PrintFile(v:fname_in)
	:function PrintFile(fname)
	:  call system("ghostview " . a:fname)
	:  call delete(a:fname)
	:  return v:shell_error
	:endfunc

Be aware that some print programs return control before they have read the
file.  If you delete the file too soon it will not be printed.  These programs
usually offer an option to have them remove the file when printing is done.
							*E365*
If evaluating the expression fails or it results in a non-zero number, you get
an error message.  In that case Vim will delete the file.  In the default
value for non-MS-Windows a trick is used: Adding "v:shell_error" will result
in a non-zero number when the system() call fails.

This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for security
reasons.

							*pfn-option* *E613*
'printfont' 'pfn'	string	(default "courier")
			global
This is the name of the font that will be used for the |:hardcopy| command's
output.  It has the same format as the 'guifont' option, except that only one
font may be named, and the special "guifont=*" syntax is not available.

In the Win32 GUI version this specifies a font name with its extra attributes,
as with the 'guifont' option.

For other systems, only ":h11" is recognized, where "11" is the point size of
the font.  When omitted, the point size is 10.

							*pheader-option*
'printheader' 'pheader'  string  (default "%<%f%h%m%=Page %N")
			 global
This defines the format of the header produced in |:hardcopy| output.  The
option is defined in the same way as the 'statusline' option.  If Vim has not
been compiled with the |+statusline| feature, this option has no effect and a
simple default header is used, which shows the page number.  The same simple
header is used when this option is empty.

							*pmbcs-option*
'printmbcharset' 'pmbcs'  string (default "")
			  global
Sets the CJK character set to be used when generating CJK output from
|:hardcopy|.  The following predefined values are currently recognised by Vim:

		Value		Description ~
  Chinese	GB_2312-80
  (Simplified)	GBT_12345-90
		MAC		Apple Mac Simplified Chinese
		GBT-90_MAC	GB/T 12345-90 Apple Mac Simplified
				  Chinese
		GBK		GBK (GB 13000.1-93)
		ISO10646	ISO 10646-1:1993

  Chinese	CNS_1993	CNS 11643-1993, Planes 1 & 2
  (Traditional)	BIG5
		ETEN		Big5 with ETen extensions
		ISO10646	ISO 10646-1:1993

  Japanese	JIS_C_1978
		JIS_X_1983
		JIS_X_1990
		MSWINDOWS	Win3.1/95J (JIS X 1997 + NEC +
				  IBM extensions)
		KANJITALK6	Apple Mac KanjiTalk V6.x
		KANJITALK7	Apple Mac KanjiTalk V7.x

  Korean	KS_X_1992
		MAC		Apple Macintosh Korean
		MSWINDOWS	KS X 1992 with MS extensions
		ISO10646	ISO 10646-1:1993

Only certain combinations of the above values and 'printencoding' are
possible.  The following tables show the valid combinations:

				euc-cn	 gbk	ucs-2	utf-8 ~
  Chinese	GB_2312-80	   x
  (Simplified)	GBT_12345-90	   x
		MAC		   x
		GBT-90_MAC	   x
		GBK			   x
		ISO10646			  x	  x

				euc-tw	 big5	ucs-2	utf-8 ~
  Chinese	CNS_1993	   x
  (Traditional)	BIG5			   x
		ETEN			   x
		ISO10646			  x	  x

				euc-jp	 sjis	ucs-2	utf-8 ~
  Japanese	JIS_C_1978	   x	   x
		JIS_X_1983	   x	   x
		JIS_X_1990	   x		  x	  x
		MSWINDOWS	   x
		KANJITALK6	   x
		KANJITALK7	   x

				euc-kr	 cp949	ucs-2	utf-8 ~
  Korean	KS_X_1992	   x
		MAC		   x
		MSWINDOWS		   x
		ISO10646			  x	  x

To set up the correct encoding and character set for printing some
Japanese text you would do the following; >
	:set printencoding=euc-jp
	:set printmbcharset=JIS_X_1983

If 'printmbcharset' is not one of the above values then it is assumed to
specify a custom multi-byte character set and no check will be made that it is
compatible with the value for 'printencoding'.  Vim will look for a file
defining the character set in the "print" directory in 'runtimepath'.

							*pmbfn-option*
'printmbfont' 'pmbfn'	string (default "")
			global
This is a comma-separated list of fields for font names to be used when
generating CJK output from |:hardcopy|.  Each font name has to be preceded
with a letter indicating the style the font is to be used for as follows:

  r:{font-name}		font to use for normal characters
  b:{font-name}		font to use for bold characters
  i:{font-name}		font to use for italic characters
  o:{font-name}		font to use for bold-italic characters

A field with the r: prefix must be specified when doing CJK printing.  The
other fontname specifiers are optional.  If a specifier is missing then
another font will be used as follows:

  if b: is missing, then use r:
  if i: is missing, then use r:
  if o: is missing, then use b:

Some CJK fonts do not contain characters for codes in the ASCII code range.
Also, some characters in the CJK ASCII code ranges differ in a few code points
from traditional ASCII characters.  There are two additional fields to control
printing of characters in the ASCII code range.

  c:yes			Use Courier font for characters in the ASCII
  c:no (default)	code range.

  a:yes			Use ASCII character set for codes in the ASCII
  a:no (default)	code range.

The following is an example of specifying two multi-byte fonts, one for normal
and italic printing and one for bold and bold-italic printing, and using
Courier to print codes in the ASCII code range but using the national
character set: >
	:set printmbfont=r:WadaMin-Regular,b:WadaMin-Bold,c:yes
<
							*popt-option*
'printoptions' 'popt'	string (default "")
			global
This is a comma-separated list of items that control the format of the output
of |:hardcopy|:

  left:{spec}		left margin (default: 10pc)
  right:{spec}		right margin (default: 5pc)
  top:{spec}		top margin (default: 5pc)
  bottom:{spec}		bottom margin (default: 5pc)
			{spec} is a number followed by "in" for inches, "pt"
			for points (1 point is 1/72 of an inch), "mm" for
			millimeters or "pc" for a percentage of the media
			size.
			Weird example:
			    left:2in,top:30pt,right:16mm,bottom:3pc
			If the unit is not recognized there is no error and
			the default value is used.

  header:{nr}		Number of lines to reserve for the header.
			Only the first line is actually filled, thus when {nr}
			is 2 there is one empty line.  The header is formatted
			according to 'printheader'.
  header:0		Do not print a header.
  header:2  (default)	Use two lines for the header

  syntax:n		Do not use syntax highlighting.  This is faster and
			thus useful when printing large files.
  syntax:y		Do syntax highlighting.
  syntax:a  (default)	Use syntax highlighting if the printer appears to be
			able to print color or grey.

  number:y		Include line numbers in the printed output.
  number:n  (default)	No line numbers.

  wrap:y    (default)	Wrap long lines.
  wrap:n		Truncate long lines.

  duplex:off		Print on one side.
  duplex:long (default)	Print on both sides (when possible), bind on long
			side.
  duplex:short		Print on both sides (when possible), bind on short
			side.

  collate:y  (default)	Collating: 1 2 3, 1 2 3, 1 2 3
  collate:n		No collating: 1 1 1, 2 2 2, 3 3 3

  jobsplit:n (default)	Do all copies in one print job
  jobsplit:y		Do each copy as a separate print job.  Useful when
			doing N-up postprocessing.

  portrait:y (default)	Orientation is portrait.
  portrait:n		Orientation is landscape.
						*a4* *letter*
  paper:A4   (default)	Paper size: A4
  paper:{name}		Paper size from this table:
			{name}	    size in cm	     size in inch ~
			10x14	    25.4  x 35.57    10    x 14
			A3	    29.7  x 42	     11.69 x 16.54
			A4	    21	  x 29.7      8.27 x 11.69
			A5	    14.8  x 21	      5.83 x  8.27
			B4	    25	  x 35.3     10.12 x 14.33
			B5	    17.6  x 25	      7.17 x 10.12
			executive   18.42 x 26.67     7.25 x 10.5
			folio	    21	  x 33	      8.27 x 13
			ledger	    43.13 x 27.96    17    x 11
			legal	    21.59 x 35.57     8.5  x 14
			letter	    21.59 x 27.96     8.5  x 11
			quarto	    21.59 x 27.5      8.5  x 10.83
			statement   13.97 x 21.59     5.5  x  8.5
			tabloid     27.96 x 43.13    11    x 17

  formfeed:n (default)	Treat form feed characters (0x0c) as a normal print
			character.
  formfeed:y		When a form feed character is encountered, continue
			printing of the current line at the beginning of the
			first line on a new page.

The item indicated with (default) is used when the item is not present.  The
values are not always used, especially when using a dialog to select the
printer and options.
Example: >
	:set printoptions=paper:letter,duplex:off

==============================================================================
3. PostScript Printing					*postscript-printing*
						*E455* *E456* *E457* *E624*
Provided you have enough disk space there should be no problems generating a
PostScript file.  You need to have the runtime files correctly installed (if
you can find the help files, they probably are).

There are currently a number of limitations with PostScript printing:

- 'printfont' - The font name is ignored (the Courier family is always used -
  it should be available on all PostScript printers) but the font size is
  used.

- 'printoptions' - The duplex setting is used when generating PostScript
  output, but it is up to the printer to take notice of the setting.  If the
  printer does not support duplex printing then it should be silently ignored.
  Some printers, however, don't print at all.

- 8-bit support - While a number of 8-bit print character encodings are
  supported it is possible that some characters will not print.  Whether a
  character will print depends on the font in the printer knowing the
  character.  Missing characters will be replaced with an upside down question
  mark, or a space if that character is also not known by the font.  It may be
  possible to get all the characters in an encoding to print by installing a
  new version of the Courier font family.

- Multi-byte support - Currently Vim will try to convert multi-byte characters
  to the 8-bit encoding specified by 'printencoding' (or latin1 if it is
  empty).  Any characters that are not successfully converted are shown as
  unknown characters.  Printing will fail if Vim cannot convert the multi-byte
  to the 8-bit encoding.

==============================================================================
4. Custom 8-bit Print Character Encodings	*postscript-print-encoding*
								*E618* *E619*
To use your own print character encoding when printing 8-bit character data
you need to define your own PostScript font encoding vector.  Details on how
to define a font encoding vector is beyond the scope of this help file, but
you can find details in the PostScript Language Reference Manual, 3rd Edition,
published by Addison-Wesley and available in PDF form at
http://www.adobe.com/.  The following describes what you need to do for Vim to
locate and use your print character encoding.

i.   Decide on a unique name for your encoding vector, one that does not clash
     with any of the recognized or standard encoding names that Vim uses (see
     |encoding-names| for a list), and that no one else is likely to use.
ii.  Copy $VIMRUNTIME/print/latin1.ps to the print subdirectory in your
     'runtimepath' and rename it with your unique name.
iii. Edit your renamed copy of latin1.ps, replacing all occurrences of latin1
     with your unique name (don't forget the line starting %%Title:), and
     modify the array of glyph names to define your new encoding vector.  The
     array must have exactly 256 entries or you will not be able to print!
iv.  Within Vim, set 'printencoding' to your unique encoding name and then
     print your file.  Vim will now use your custom print character encoding.

Vim will report an error with the resource file if you change the order or
content of the first 3 lines, other than the name of the encoding on the line
starting %%Title: or the version number on the line starting %%Version:.

[Technical explanation for those that know PostScript - Vim looks for a file
with the same name as the encoding it will use when printing.  The file
defines a new PostScript Encoding resource called /VIM-name, where name is the
print character encoding Vim will use.]

==============================================================================
5. PostScript CJK Printing			*postscript-cjk-printing*
							*E673* *E674* *E675*

Vim supports printing of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean files.  Setting up Vim
to correctly print CJK files requires setting up a few more options.

Each of these countries has many standard character sets and encodings which
require that both be specified when printing.  In addition, CJK fonts normally
do not have the concept of italic glyphs and use different weight or stroke
style to achieve emphasis when printing.  This in turn requires a different
approach to specifying fonts to use when printing.

The encoding and character set are specified with the 'printencoding' and
'printmbcharset' options.  If 'printencoding' is not specified then 'encoding'
is used as normal.  If 'printencoding' is specified then characters will be
translated to this encoding for printing.  You should ensure that the encoding
is compatible with the character set needed for the file contents or some
characters may not appear when printed.

The fonts to use for CJK printing are specified with 'printmbfont'.  This
option allows you to specify different fonts to use when printing characters
which are syntax highlighted with the font styles normal, italic, bold and
bold-italic.

No CJK fonts are supplied with Vim.  There are some free Korean, Japanese, and
Traditional Chinese fonts available at:

  http://examples.oreilly.com/cjkvinfo/adobe/samples/

You can find descriptions of the various fonts in the read me file at

  http://examples.oreilly.de/english_examples/cjkvinfo/adobe/00README

Please read your printer documentation on how to install new fonts.

CJK fonts can be large containing several thousand glyphs, and it is not
uncommon to find that they only contain a subset of a national standard.  It
is not unusual to find the fonts to not include characters for codes in the
ASCII code range.  If you find half-width Roman characters are not appearing
in your printout then you should configure Vim to use the Courier font the
half-width ASCII characters with 'printmbfont'.  If your font does not include
other characters then you will need to find another font that does.

Another issue with ASCII characters, is that the various national character
sets specify a couple of different glyphs in the ASCII code range.  If you
print ASCII text using the national character set you may see some unexpected
characters.  If you want true ASCII code printing then you need to configure
Vim to output ASCII characters for the ASCII code range with 'printmbfont'.

It is possible to define your own multi-byte character set although this
should not be attempted lightly.  A discussion on the process if beyond the
scope of these help files.  You can find details on CMap (character map) files
in the document 'Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Specification, Version 1.0',
available from http://www.adobe.com as a PDF file.

==============================================================================
6. PostScript Printing Troubleshooting		*postscript-print-trouble*
									*E621*
Usually the only sign of a problem when printing with PostScript is that your
printout does not appear.  If you are lucky you may get a printed page that
tells you the PostScript operator that generated the error that prevented the
print job completing.

There are a number of possible causes as to why the printing may have failed:

- Wrong version of the prolog resource file.  The prolog resource file
  contains some PostScript that Vim needs to be able to print.  Each version
  of Vim needs one particular version.  Make sure you have correctly installed
  the runtime files, and don't have any old versions of a file called prolog
  in the print directory in your 'runtimepath' directory.

- Paper size.  Some PostScript printers will abort printing a file if they do
  not support the requested paper size.  By default Vim uses A4 paper.  Find
  out what size paper your printer normally uses and set the appropriate paper
  size with 'printoptions'.  If you cannot find the name of the paper used,
  measure a sheet and compare it with the table of supported paper sizes listed
  for 'printoptions', using the paper that is closest in both width AND height.
  Note: The dimensions of actual paper may vary slightly from the ones listed.
  If there is no paper listed close enough, then you may want to try psresize
  from PSUtils, discussed below.

- Two-sided printing (duplex).  Normally a PostScript printer that does not
  support two-sided printing will ignore any request to do it.  However, some
  printers may abort the job altogether.  Try printing with duplex turned off.
  Note: Duplex prints can be achieved manually using PS utils - see below.

- Collated printing.  As with Duplex printing, most PostScript printers that
  do not support collating printouts will ignore a request to do so.  Some may
  not.  Try printing with collation turned off.

- Syntax highlighting.  Some print management code may prevent the generated
  PostScript file from being printed on a black and white printer when syntax
  highlighting is turned on, even if solid black is the only color used.  Try
  printing with syntax highlighting turned off.

A safe printoptions setting to try is: >

	:set printoptions=paper:A4,duplex:off,collate:n,syntax:n

Replace "A4" with the paper size that best matches your printer paper.

==============================================================================
7. PostScript Utilities				*postscript-print-util*

7.1 Ghostscript

Ghostscript is a PostScript and PDF interpreter that can be used to display
and print on non-PostScript printers PostScript and PDF files.  It can also
generate PDF files from PostScript.

Ghostscript will run on a wide variety of platforms.

There are three available versions:

- AFPL Ghostscript (formerly Aladdin Ghostscript) which is free for
  non-commercial use.  It can be obtained from:

    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/

- GNU Ghostscript which is available under the GNU General Public License.  It
  can be obtained from:

    ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/gnu/

- A commercial version for inclusion in commercial products.

Additional information on Ghostscript can also be found at:

  http://www.ghostscript.com/

Support for a number of non PostScript printers is provided in the
distribution as standard, but if you cannot find support for your printer
check the Ghostscript site for other printers not included by default.


7.2 Ghostscript Previewers.

The interface to Ghostscript is very primitive so a number of graphical front
ends have been created.  These allow easier PostScript file selection,
previewing at different zoom levels, and printing.  Check supplied
documentation for full details.

7.3 PSUtils

PSUtils is a collection of utility programs for manipulating PostScript
documents.  Binary distributions are available for many platforms, as well as
the full source.  PSUtils can be found at:

  http://knackered.org/angus/psutils

The utilities of interest include:

- psnup.     Convert PS files for N-up printing.
- psselect.  Select page range and order of printing.
- psresize.  Change the page size.
- psbook.    Reorder and lay out pages ready for making a book.

The output of one program can be used as the input to the next, allowing for
complex print document creation.


N-UP PRINTING

The psnup utility takes an existing PostScript file generated from Vim and
convert it to an n-up version.  The simplest way to create a 2-up printout is
to first create a PostScript file with: >

	:hardcopy > test.ps

Then on your command line execute: >

	psnup -n 2 test.ps final.ps

Note: You may get warnings from some Ghostscript previewers for files produced
by psnup - these may safely be ignored.

Finally print the file final.ps to your PostScript printer with your
platform's print command.  (You will need to delete the two PostScript files
afterwards yourself.)  'printexpr' could be modified to perform this extra
step before printing.


ALTERNATE DUPLEX PRINTING

It is possible to achieve a poor man's version of duplex printing using the PS
utility psselect.  This utility has options -e and -o for printing just the
even or odd pages of a PS file respectively.

First generate a PS file with the 'hardcopy' command, then generate new
files with all the odd and even numbered pages with: >

	psselect -o test.ps odd.ps
	psselect -e test.ps even.ps

Next print odd.ps with your platform's normal print command.  Then take the
print output, turn it over and place it back in the paper feeder.  Now print
even.ps with your platform's print command.  All the even pages should now
appear on the back of the odd pages.

There are a couple of points to bear in mind:

1. Position of the first page.  If the first page is on top of the printout
   when printing the odd pages then you need to reverse the order that the odd
   pages are printed.  This can be done with the -r option to psselect.  This
   will ensure page 2 is printed on the back of page 1.
   Note: it is better to reverse the odd numbered pages rather than the even
   numbered in case there are an odd number of pages in the original PS file.

2. Paper flipping.  When turning over the paper with the odd pages printed on
   them you may have to either flip them horizontally (along the long edge) or
   vertically (along the short edge), as well as possibly rotating them 180
   degrees.  All this depends on the printer - it will be more obvious for
   desktop ink jets than for small office laser printers where the paper path
   is hidden from view.


==============================================================================
8. Formfeed Characters					*printing-formfeed*

By default Vim does not do any special processing of |formfeed| control
characters.  Setting the 'printoptions' formfeed item will make Vim recognize
formfeed characters and continue printing the current line at the beginning
of the first line on a new page.  The use of formfeed characters provides
rudimentary print control but there are certain things to be aware of.

Vim will always start printing a line (including a line number if enabled)
containing a formfeed character, even if it is the first character on the
line.  This means if a line starting with a formfeed character is the first
line of a page then Vim will print a blank page.

Since the line number is printed at the start of printing the line containing
the formfeed character, the remainder of the line printed on the new page
will not have a line number printed for it (in the same way as the wrapped
lines of a long line when wrap in 'printoptions' is enabled).

If the formfeed character is the last character on a line, then printing will
continue on the second line of the new page, not the first.  This is due to
Vim processing the end of the line after the formfeed character and moving
down a line to continue printing.

Due to the points made above it is recommended that when formfeed character
processing is enabled, printing of line numbers is disabled, and that form
feed characters are not the last character on a line.  Even then you may need
to adjust the number of lines before a formfeed character to prevent
accidental blank pages.

Vim client-server communication				*client-server*

1. Common functionality		|clientserver|
2. X11 specific items		|x11-clientserver|
3. MS-Windows specific items	|w32-clientserver|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Common functionality					*clientserver*

When compiled with the |+clientserver| option, Vim can act as a command
server.  It accepts messages from a client and executes them.  At the same
time, Vim can function as a client and send commands to a Vim server.

The following command line arguments are available:

    argument			meaning	~

   --remote [+{cmd}] {file} ...					*--remote*
				Open the file list in a remote Vim.  When
				there is no Vim server, execute locally.
				There is one optional init command: +{cmd}.
				This must be an Ex command that can be
				followed by "|".
				The rest of the command line is taken as the
				file list.  Thus any non-file arguments must
				come before this.
				You cannot edit stdin this way |--|.
				The remote Vim is raised.  If you don't want
				this use >
				 vim --remote-send "<C-\><C-N>:n filename<CR>"
<
   --remote-silent [+{cmd}] {file} ...			*--remote-silent*
				As above, but don't complain if there is no
				server and the file is edited locally.
   --remote-wait [+{cmd}] {file} ...				*--remote-wait*
				As --remote, but wait for files to complete
				(unload) in remote Vim.
   --remote-wait-silent [+{cmd}] {file} ...		*--remote-wait-silent*
				As --remote-wait, but don't complain if there
				is no server.
							*--remote-tab*
   --remote-tab			Like --remote but open each file in a new
				tabpage.
							*--remote-tab-silent*
   --remote-tab-silent		Like --remote-silent but open each file in a
				new tabpage.
							*--remote-tab-wait*
   --remote-tab-wait		Like --remote-wait but open each file in a new
				tabpage.

						*--remote-tab-wait-silent*
   --remote-tab-wait-silent	Like --remote-wait-silent but open each file
				in a new tabpage.
								*--servername*
   --servername {name}		Become the server {name}.  When used together
				with one of the --remote commands: connect to
				server {name} instead of the default (see
				below).
								*--remote-send*
   --remote-send {keys}		Send {keys} to server and exit.  The {keys}
   				are not mapped.  Special key names are
				recognized, e.g., "<CR>" results in a CR
				character.
								*--remote-expr*
   --remote-expr {expr}		Evaluate {expr} in server and print the result
				on stdout.
								*--serverlist*
   --serverlist			Output a list of server names.


Examples ~

Edit "file.txt" in an already running GVIM server: >
    gvim --remote file.txt

Edit "file.txt" in an already running server called FOOBAR: >
    gvim --servername FOOBAR --remote file.txt

Edit "file.txt" in server "FILES" if it exists, become server "FILES"
otherwise: >
    gvim --servername FILES --remote-silent file.txt

This doesn't work, all arguments after --remote will be used as file names: >
    gvim --remote --servername FOOBAR file.txt

Edit file "+foo" in a remote server (note the use of "./" to avoid the special
meaning of the leading plus): >
    vim --remote ./+foo

Tell the remote server "BLA" to write all files and exit: >
    vim --servername BLA --remote-send '<C-\><C-N>:wqa<CR>'


SERVER NAME						*client-server-name*

By default Vim will try to register the name under which it was invoked (gvim,
egvim ...).  This can be overridden with the --servername argument.  If the
specified name is not available, a postfix is applied until a free name is
encountered, i.e. "gvim1" for the second invocation of gvim on a particular
X-server.  The resulting name is available in the servername builtin variable
|v:servername|.  The case of the server name is ignored, thus "gvim" and
"GVIM" are considered equal.

When Vim is invoked with --remote, --remote-wait or --remote-send it will try
to locate the server name determined by the invocation name and --servername
argument as described above.  If an exact match is not available, the first
server with the number postfix will be used.  If a name with the number
postfix is specified with the --servername argument, it must match exactly.

If no server can be located and --remote or --remote-wait was used, Vim will
start up according to the rest of the command line and do the editing by
itself.  This way it is not necessary to know whether gvim is already started
when sending command to it.

The --serverlist argument will cause Vim to print a list of registered command
servers on the standard output (stdout) and exit.

Win32 Note: Making the Vim server go to the foreground doesn't always work,
because MS-Windows doesn't allow it.  The client will move the server to the
foreground when using the --remote or --remote-wait argument and the server
name starts with "g".


REMOTE EDITING

The --remote argument will cause a |:drop| command to be constructed from the
rest of the command line and sent as described above.
The --remote-wait argument does the same thing and additionally sets up to
wait for each of the files to have been edited.  This uses the BufUnload
event, thus as soon as a file has been unloaded, Vim assumes you are done
editing it.
Note that the --remote and --remote-wait arguments will consume the rest of
the command line.  I.e. all remaining arguments will be regarded as filenames.
You can not put options there!


FUNCTIONS
								*E240* *E573*
There are a number of Vim functions for scripting the command server.  See
the description in |eval.txt| or use CTRL-] on the function name to jump to
the full explanation.

    synopsis				     explanation ~
    remote_startserver( name)		     run a server
    remote_expr( server, string, idvar)      send expression
    remote_send( server, string, idvar)      send key sequence
    serverlist()			     get a list of available servers
    remote_peek( serverid, retvar)	     check for reply string
    remote_read( serverid)		     read reply string
    server2client( serverid, string)	     send reply string
    remote_foreground( server)		     bring server to the front

See also the explanation of |CTRL-\_CTRL-N|.  Very useful as a leading key
sequence.
The {serverid} for server2client() can be obtained with expand("<client>")

==============================================================================
2. X11 specific items					*x11-clientserver*
				    *E247* *E248* *E251* *E258* *E277*

The communication between client and server goes through the X server.  The
display of the Vim server must be specified.  The usual protection of the X
server is used, you must be able to open a window on the X server for the
communication to work.  It is possible to communicate between different
systems.

By default, a GUI Vim will register a name on the X-server by which it can be
addressed for subsequent execution of injected strings.  Vim can also act as
a client and send strings to other instances of Vim on the same X11 display.

When an X11 GUI Vim (gvim) is started, it will try to register a send-server
name on the 'VimRegistry' property on the root window.

A non GUI Vim with access to the X11 display (|xterm-clipboard| enabled), can
also act as a command server if a server name is explicitly given with the
--servername argument.

An empty --servername argument will cause the command server to be disabled.

To send commands to a Vim server from another application, read the source
file src/if_xcmdsrv.c, it contains some hints about the protocol used.

==============================================================================
3. Win32 specific items					*w32-clientserver*

Every Win32 Vim can work as a server, also in the console.  You do not need a
version compiled with OLE.  Windows messages are used, this works on any
version of MS-Windows.  But only communication within one system is possible.

Since MS-Windows messages are used, any other application should be able to
communicate with a Vim server.  An alternative is using the OLE functionality
|ole-interface|.

When using gvim, the --remote-wait only works properly this way: >

	start /w gvim --remote-wait file.txt

Terminal information					*terminal-info*

Vim uses information about the terminal you are using to fill the screen and
recognize what keys you hit.  If this information is not correct, the screen
may be messed up or keys may not be recognized.  The actions which have to be
performed on the screen are accomplished by outputting a string of
characters.  Special keys produce a string of characters.  These strings are
stored in the terminal options, see |terminal-options|.

NOTE: Most of this is not used when running the |GUI|.

1. Startup			|startup-terminal|
2. Terminal options		|terminal-options|
3. Window size			|window-size|
4. Slow and fast terminals	|slow-fast-terminal|
5. Using the mouse		|mouse-using|

==============================================================================
1. Startup						*startup-terminal*

When Vim is started a default terminal type is assumed.  For the Amiga this is
a standard CLI window, for MS-DOS the pc terminal, for Unix an ansi terminal.
A few other terminal types are always available, see below |builtin-terms|.

You can give the terminal name with the '-T' Vim argument.  If it is not given
Vim will try to get the name from the TERM environment variable.

				*termcap* *terminfo* *E557* *E558* *E559*
On Unix the terminfo database or termcap file is used.  This is referred to as
"termcap" in all the documentation.  At compile time, when running configure,
the choice whether to use terminfo or termcap is done automatically.  When
running Vim the output of ":version" will show |+terminfo| if terminfo is
used.  Also see |xterm-screens|.

On non-Unix systems a termcap is only available if Vim was compiled with
TERMCAP defined.

					*builtin-terms* *builtin_terms*
Which builtin terminals are available depends on a few defines in feature.h,
which need to be set at compile time:
    define		output of ":version"	terminals builtin	~
NO_BUILTIN_TCAPS	-builtin_terms		none
SOME_BUILTIN_TCAPS	+builtin_terms		most common ones (default)
ALL_BUILTIN_TCAPS	++builtin_terms		all available

You can see a list of available builtin terminals with ":set term=xxx" (when
not running the GUI).  Also see |+builtin_terms|.

If the termcap code is included Vim will try to get the strings for the
terminal you are using from the termcap file and the builtin termcaps.  Both
are always used, if an entry for the terminal you are using is present.  Which
one is used first depends on the 'ttybuiltin' option:

'ttybuiltin' on		1: builtin termcap	2: external termcap
'ttybuiltin' off	1: external termcap	2: builtin termcap

If an option is missing in one of them, it will be obtained from the other
one.  If an option is present in both, the one first encountered is used.

Which external termcap file is used varies from system to system and may
depend on the environment variables "TERMCAP" and "TERMPATH".  See "man
tgetent".

Settings depending on terminal			*term-dependent-settings*

If you want to set options or mappings, depending on the terminal name, you
can do this best in your .vimrc.  Example: >

   if &term == "xterm"
     ... xterm maps and settings ...
   elseif &term =~ "vt10."
     ... vt100, vt102 maps and settings ...
   endif
<
						*raw-terminal-mode*
For normal editing the terminal will be put into "raw" mode.  The strings
defined with 't_ti' and 't_ks' will be sent to the terminal.  Normally this
puts the terminal in a state where the termcap codes are valid and activates
the cursor and function keys.  When Vim exits the terminal will be put back
into the mode it was before Vim started.  The strings defined with 't_te' and
't_ke' will be sent to the terminal.  On the Amiga, with commands that execute
an external command (e.g., "!!"), the terminal will be put into Normal mode
for a moment.  This means that you can stop the output to the screen by
hitting a printing key.  Output resumes when you hit <BS>.

						*xterm-bracketed-paste*
When the 't_BE' option is set then 't_BE' will be sent to the
terminal when entering "raw" mode and 't_BD' when leaving "raw" mode.  The
terminal is then expected to put 't_PS' before pasted text and 't_PE' after
pasted text.  This way Vim can separate text that is pasted from characters
that are typed.  The pasted text is handled like when the middle mouse button
is used, it is inserted literally and not interpreted as commands.

When the cursor is in the first column, the pasted text will be inserted
before it.  Otherwise the pasted text is appended after the cursor position.
This means one cannot paste after the first column.  Unfortunately Vim does
not have a way to tell where the mouse pointer was.

Note that in some situations Vim will not recognize the bracketed paste and
you will get the raw text.  In other situations Vim will only get the first
pasted character and drop the rest, e.g. when using the "r" command.  If you
have a problem with this, disable bracketed paste by putting this in your
.vimrc: >
	set t_BE=
If this is done while Vim is running the 't_BD' will be sent to the terminal
to disable bracketed paste.

							*cs7-problem*
Note: If the terminal settings are changed after running Vim, you might have
an illegal combination of settings.  This has been reported on Solaris 2.5
with "stty cs8 parenb", which is restored as "stty cs7 parenb".  Use
"stty cs8 -parenb -istrip" instead, this is restored correctly.

Some termcap entries are wrong in the sense that after sending 't_ks' the
cursor keys send codes different from the codes defined in the termcap.  To
avoid this you can set 't_ks' (and 't_ke') to empty strings.  This must be
done during initialization (see |initialization|), otherwise it's too late.

Some termcap entries assume that the highest bit is always reset.  For
example: The cursor-up entry for the Amiga could be ":ku=\E[A:".  But the
Amiga really sends "\233A".  This works fine if the highest bit is reset,
e.g., when using an Amiga over a serial line.  If the cursor keys don't work,
try the entry ":ku=\233A:".

Some termcap entries have the entry ":ku=\E[A:".  But the Amiga really sends
"\233A".  On output "\E[" and "\233" are often equivalent, on input they
aren't.  You will have to change the termcap entry, or change the key code with
the :set command to fix this.

Many cursor key codes start with an <Esc>.  Vim must find out if this is a
single hit of the <Esc> key or the start of a cursor key sequence.  It waits
for a next character to arrive.  If it does not arrive within one second a
single <Esc> is assumed.  On very slow systems this may fail, causing cursor
keys not to work sometimes.  If you discover this problem reset the 'timeout'
option.  Vim will wait for the next character to arrive after an <Esc>.  If
you want to enter a single <Esc> you must type it twice.  Resetting the
'esckeys' option avoids this problem in Insert mode, but you lose the
possibility to use cursor and function keys in Insert mode.

On the Amiga the recognition of window resizing is activated only when the
terminal name is "amiga" or "builtin_amiga".

Some terminals have confusing codes for the cursor keys.  The televideo 925 is
such a terminal.  It sends a CTRL-H for cursor-left.  This would make it
impossible to distinguish a backspace and cursor-left.  To avoid this problem
CTRL-H is never recognized as cursor-left.

					*vt100-cursor-keys* *xterm-cursor-keys*
Other terminals (e.g., vt100 and xterm) have cursor keys that send <Esc>OA,
<Esc>OB, etc.  Unfortunately these are valid commands in insert mode: Stop
insert, Open a new line above the new one, start inserting 'A', 'B', etc.
Instead of performing these commands Vim will erroneously recognize this typed
key sequence as a cursor key movement.  To avoid this and make Vim do what you
want in either case you could use these settings: >
	:set notimeout		" don't timeout on mappings
	:set ttimeout		" do timeout on terminal key codes
	:set timeoutlen=100	" timeout after 100 msec
This requires the key-codes to be sent within 100 msec in order to recognize
them as a cursor key.  When you type you normally are not that fast, so they
are recognized as individual typed commands, even though Vim receives the same
sequence of bytes.

				*vt100-function-keys* *xterm-function-keys*
An xterm can send function keys F1 to F4 in two modes: vt100 compatible or
not.  Because Vim may not know what the xterm is sending, both types of keys
are recognized.  The same happens for the <Home> and <End> keys.
			normal			vt100 ~
	<F1>	t_k1	<Esc>[11~	<xF1>	<Esc>OP	    *<xF1>-xterm*
	<F2>	t_k2	<Esc>[12~	<xF2>	<Esc>OQ	    *<xF2>-xterm*
	<F3>	t_k3	<Esc>[13~	<xF3>	<Esc>OR	    *<xF3>-xterm*
	<F4>	t_k4	<Esc>[14~	<xF4>	<Esc>OS	    *<xF4>-xterm*
	<Home>	t_kh	<Esc>[7~	<xHome>	<Esc>OH	    *<xHome>-xterm*
	<End>	t_@7	<Esc>[4~	<xEnd>	<Esc>OF	    *<xEnd>-xterm*

When Vim starts, <xF1> is mapped to <F1>, <xF2> to <F2> etc.  This means that
by default both codes do the same thing.  If you make a mapping for <xF2>,
because your terminal does have two keys, the default mapping is overwritten,
thus you can use the <F2> and <xF2> keys for something different.

							*xterm-shifted-keys*
Newer versions of xterm support shifted function keys and special keys.  Vim
recognizes most of them.  Use ":set termcap" to check which are supported and
what the codes are.  Mostly these are not in a termcap, they are only
supported by the builtin_xterm termcap.

							*xterm-modifier-keys*
Newer versions of xterm support Alt and Ctrl for most function keys.  To avoid
having to add all combinations of Alt, Ctrl and Shift for every key a special
sequence is recognized at the end of a termcap entry: ";*X".  The "X" can be
any character, often '~' is used.  The ";*" stands for an optional modifier
argument.  ";2" is Shift, ";3" is Alt, ";5" is Ctrl and ";9" is Meta (when
it's different from Alt).  They can be combined.  Examples: >
	:set <F8>=^[[19;*~
	:set <Home>=^[[1;*H
Another speciality about these codes is that they are not overwritten by
another code.  That is to avoid that the codes obtained from xterm directly
|t_RV| overwrite them.
							*xterm-scroll-region*
The default termcap entry for xterm on Sun and other platforms does not
contain the entry for scroll regions.  Add ":cs=\E[%i%d;%dr:" to the xterm
entry in /etc/termcap and everything should work.

							*xterm-end-home-keys*
On some systems (at least on FreeBSD with XFree86 3.1.2) the codes that the
<End> and <Home> keys send contain a <Nul> character.  To make these keys send
the proper key code, add these lines to your ~/.Xdefaults file:

*VT100.Translations:		#override \n\
		<Key>Home: string("0x1b") string("[7~") \n\
		<Key>End: string("0x1b") string("[8~")

						*xterm-8bit* *xterm-8-bit*
Xterm can be run in a mode where it uses 8-bit escape sequences.  The CSI code
is used instead of <Esc>[.  The advantage is that an <Esc> can quickly be
recognized in Insert mode, because it can't be confused with the start of a
special key.
For the builtin termcap entries, Vim checks if the 'term' option contains
"8bit" anywhere.  It then uses 8-bit characters for the termcap entries, the
mouse and a few other things.  You would normally set $TERM in your shell to
"xterm-8bit" and Vim picks this up and adjusts to the 8-bit setting
automatically.
When Vim receives a response to the |t_RV| (request version) sequence and it
starts with CSI, it assumes that the terminal is in 8-bit mode and will
convert all key sequences to their 8-bit variants.

==============================================================================
2. Terminal options		*terminal-options* *termcap-options* *E436*

The terminal options can be set just like normal options.  But they are not
shown with the ":set all" command.  Instead use ":set termcap".

It is always possible to change individual strings by setting the
appropriate option.  For example: >
	:set t_ce=^V^[[K	(CTRL-V, <Esc>, [, K)

{Vi: no terminal options.  You have to exit Vi, edit the termcap entry and
try again}

The options are listed below.  The associated termcap code is always equal to
the last two characters of the option name.  Only one termcap code is
required: Cursor motion, 't_cm'.

The options 't_da', 't_db', 't_ms', 't_xs', 't_xn' represent flags in the
termcap.  When the termcap flag is present, the option will be set to "y".
But any non-empty string means that the flag is set.  An empty string means
that the flag is not set.  't_CS' works like this too, but it isn't a termcap
flag.

Note about t_so and t_mr: When the termcap entry "so" is not present the
entry for "mr" is used.  And vice versa.  The same is done for "se" and "me".
If your terminal supports both inversion and standout mode, you can see two
different modes.  If your terminal supports only one of the modes, both will
look the same.

							*keypad-comma*
The keypad keys, when they are not mapped, behave like the equivalent normal
key.  There is one exception: if you have a comma on the keypad instead of a
decimal point, Vim will use a dot anyway.  Use these mappings to fix that: >
	:noremap <kPoint> ,
	:noremap! <kPoint> ,
<							*xterm-codes*
There is a special trick to obtain the key codes which currently only works
for xterm.  When |t_RV| is defined and a response is received which indicates
an xterm with patchlevel 141 or higher, Vim uses special escape sequences to
request the key codes directly from the xterm.  The responses are used to
adjust the various t_ codes.  This avoids the problem that the xterm can
produce different codes, depending on the mode it is in (8-bit, VT102,
VT220, etc.).  The result is that codes like <xF1> are no longer needed.
Note: This is only done on startup.  If the xterm options are changed after
Vim has started, the escape sequences may not be recognized anymore.

							*xterm-true-color*
Vim supports using true colors in the terminal (taken from |highlight-guifg|
and |highlight-guibg|), given that the terminal supports this. To make this 
work the 'termguicolors' option needs to be set.
See https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728 for a list of terminals that
support true colors.

Sometimes setting 'termguicolors' is not enough and one has to set the |t_8f|
and |t_8b| options explicitly. Default values of these options are
"^[[38;2;%lu;%lu;%lum" and "^[[48;2;%lu;%lu;%lum" respectively, but it is only
set when `$TERM` is `xterm`. Some terminals accept the same sequences, but
with all semicolons replaced by colons (this is actually more compatible, but
less widely supported): >
	 let &t_8f = "\<Esc>[38:2:%lu:%lu:%lum"
	 let &t_8b = "\<Esc>[48:2:%lu:%lu:%lum"

These options contain printf strings, with |printf()| (actually, its C
equivalent hence `l` modifier) invoked with the t_ option value and three
unsigned long integers that may have any value between 0 and 255 (inclusive)
representing red, green and blue colors respectively.

							*xterm-resize*
Window resizing with xterm only works if the allowWindowOps resource is
enabled.  On some systems and versions of xterm it's disabled by default
because someone thought it would be a security issue.  It's not clear if this
is actually the case.

To overrule the default, put this line in your ~/.Xdefaults or
~/.Xresources:
>
	XTerm*allowWindowOps: 		true

And run "xrdb -merge .Xresources" to make it effective.  You can check the
value with the context menu (right mouse button while CTRL key is pressed),
there should be a tick at allow-window-ops.

							*termcap-colors*
Note about colors: The 't_Co' option tells Vim the number of colors available.
When it is non-zero, the 't_AB' and 't_AF' options are used to set the color.
If one of these is not available, 't_Sb' and 't_Sf' are used.  't_me' is used
to reset to the default colors.

				*termcap-cursor-shape* *termcap-cursor-color*
When Vim enters Insert mode the 't_SI' escape sequence is sent.  When Vim
enters Replace mode the 't_SR' escape sequence is sent if it is set, otherwise
't_SI' is sent.  When leaving Insert mode or Replace mode 't_EI' is used. This
can be used to change the shape or color of the cursor in Insert or Replace
mode. These are not standard termcap/terminfo entries, you need to set them
yourself.
Example for an xterm, this changes the color of the cursor: >
    if &term =~ "xterm"
	let &t_SI = "\<Esc>]12;purple\x7"
	let &t_SR = "\<Esc>]12;red\x7"
	let &t_EI = "\<Esc>]12;blue\x7"
    endif
NOTE: When Vim exits the shape for Normal mode will remain.  The shape from
before Vim started will not be restored.
{not available when compiled without the |+cursorshape| feature}

							*termcap-title*
The 't_ts' and 't_fs' options are used to set the window title if the terminal
allows title setting via sending strings.  They are sent before and after the
title string, respectively.  Similar 't_IS' and 't_IE'  are used to set the
icon text.  These are Vim-internal extensions of the Unix termcap, so they
cannot be obtained from an external termcap.  However, the builtin termcap
contains suitable entries for xterm and iris-ansi, so you don't need to set
them here.
							*hpterm*
If inversion or other highlighting does not work correctly, try setting the
't_xs' option to a non-empty string.  This makes the 't_ce' code be used to
remove highlighting from a line.  This is required for "hpterm".  Setting the
'weirdinvert' option has the same effect as making 't_xs' non-empty, and vice
versa.

							*scroll-region*
Some termcaps do not include an entry for 'cs' (scroll region), although the
terminal does support it.  For example: xterm on a Sun.  You can use the
builtin_xterm or define t_cs yourself.  For example: >
	:set t_cs=^V^[[%i%d;%dr
Where ^V is CTRL-V and ^[ is <Esc>.

The vertical scroll region t_CV is not a standard termcap code.  Vim uses it
internally in the GUI.  But it can also be defined for a terminal, if you can
find one that supports it.  The two arguments are the left and right column of
the region which to restrict the scrolling to.  Just like t_cs defines the top
and bottom lines.  Defining t_CV will make scrolling in vertically split
windows a lot faster.  Don't set t_CV when t_da or t_db is set (text isn't
cleared when scrolling).

Unfortunately it is not possible to deduce from the termcap how cursor
positioning should be done when using a scrolling region: Relative to the
beginning of the screen or relative to the beginning of the scrolling region.
Most terminals use the first method.  A known exception is the MS-DOS console
(pcterm).  The 't_CS' option should be set to any string when cursor
positioning is relative to the start of the scrolling region.  It should be
set to an empty string otherwise.  It defaults to "yes" when 'term' is
"pcterm".

Note for xterm users: The shifted cursor keys normally don't work.  You can
	make them work with the xmodmap command and some mappings in Vim.

	Give these commands in the xterm:
		xmodmap -e "keysym Up = Up F13"
		xmodmap -e "keysym Down = Down F16"
		xmodmap -e "keysym Left = Left F18"
		xmodmap -e "keysym Right = Right F19"

	And use these mappings in Vim:
		:map <t_F3> <S-Up>
		:map! <t_F3> <S-Up>
		:map <t_F6> <S-Down>
		:map! <t_F6> <S-Down>
		:map <t_F8> <S-Left>
		:map! <t_F8> <S-Left>
		:map <t_F9> <S-Right>
		:map! <t_F9> <S-Right>

Instead of, say, <S-Up> you can use any other command that you want to use the
shift-cursor-up key for.  (Note: To help people that have a Sun keyboard with
left side keys F14 is not used because it is confused with the undo key; F15
is not used, because it does a window-to-front; F17 is not used, because it
closes the window.  On other systems you can probably use them.)

==============================================================================
3. Window size						*window-size*

[This is about the size of the whole window Vim is using, not a window that is
created with the ":split" command.]

If you are running Vim on an Amiga and the terminal name is "amiga" or
"builtin_amiga", the amiga-specific window resizing will be enabled.  On Unix
systems three methods are tried to get the window size:

- an ioctl call (TIOCGSIZE or TIOCGWINSZ, depends on your system)
- the environment variables "LINES" and "COLUMNS"
- from the termcap entries "li" and "co"

If everything fails a default size of 24 lines and 80 columns is assumed.  If
a window-resize signal is received the size will be set again.  If the window
size is wrong you can use the 'lines' and 'columns' options to set the
correct values.

One command can be used to set the screen size:

						*:mod* *:mode* *E359*
:mod[e] [mode]

Without argument this only detects the screen size and redraws the screen.
With MS-DOS it is possible to switch screen mode.  [mode] can be one of these
values:
	"bw40"		40 columns black&white
	"c40"		40 columns color
	"bw80"		80 columns black&white
	"c80"		80 columns color (most people use this)
	"mono"		80 columns monochrome
	"c4350"		43 or 50 lines EGA/VGA mode
	number		mode number to use, depends on your video card

==============================================================================
4. Slow and fast terminals			*slow-fast-terminal*
						*slow-terminal*

If you have a fast terminal you may like to set the 'ruler' option.  The
cursor position is shown in the status line.  If you are using horizontal
scrolling ('wrap' option off) consider setting 'sidescroll' to a small
number.

If you have a slow terminal you may want to reset the 'showcmd' option.
The command characters will not be shown in the status line.  If the terminal
scrolls very slowly, set the 'scrolljump' to 5 or so.  If the cursor is moved
off the screen (e.g., with "j") Vim will scroll 5 lines at a time.  Another
possibility is to reduce the number of lines that Vim uses with the command
"z{height}<CR>".

If the characters from the terminal are arriving with more than 1 second
between them you might want to set the 'timeout' and/or 'ttimeout' option.
See the "Options" chapter |options|.

If your terminal does not support a scrolling region, but it does support
insert/delete line commands, scrolling with multiple windows may make the
lines jump up and down.  If you don't want this set the 'ttyfast' option.
This will redraw the window instead of scroll it.

If your terminal scrolls very slowly, but redrawing is not slow, set the
'ttyscroll' option to a small number, e.g., 3.  This will make Vim redraw the
screen instead of scrolling, when there are more than 3 lines to be scrolled.

If you are using a color terminal that is slow, use this command: >
	hi NonText cterm=NONE ctermfg=NONE
This avoids that spaces are sent when they have different attributes.  On most
terminals you can't see this anyway.

If you are using Vim over a slow serial line, you might want to try running
Vim inside the "screen" program.  Screen will optimize the terminal I/O quite
a bit.

If you are testing termcap options, but you cannot see what is happening,
you might want to set the 'writedelay' option.  When non-zero, one character
is sent to the terminal at a time (does not work for MS-DOS).  This makes the
screen updating a lot slower, making it possible to see what is happening.

==============================================================================
5. Using the mouse					*mouse-using*

This section is about using the mouse on a terminal or a terminal window.  How
to use the mouse in a GUI window is explained in |gui-mouse|.  For scrolling
with a mouse wheel see |scroll-mouse-wheel|.

Don't forget to enable the mouse with this command: >
	:set mouse=a
Otherwise Vim won't recognize the mouse in all modes (See 'mouse').

Currently the mouse is supported for Unix in an xterm window, in a *BSD
console with |sysmouse|, in a Linux console (with GPM |gpm-mouse|), for
MS-DOS and in a Windows console.
Mouse clicks can be used to position the cursor, select an area and paste.

These characters in the 'mouse' option tell in which situations the mouse will
be used by Vim:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		i	Insert mode
		c	Command-line mode
		h	all previous modes when in a help file
		a	all previous modes
		r	for |hit-enter| prompt

The default for 'mouse' is empty, the mouse is not used.  Normally you would
do: >
	:set mouse=a
to start using the mouse (this is equivalent to setting 'mouse' to "nvich").
If you only want to use the mouse in a few modes or also want to use it for
the two questions you will have to concatenate the letters for those modes.
For example: >
	:set mouse=nv
Will make the mouse work in Normal mode and Visual mode. >
	:set mouse=h
Will make the mouse work in help files only (so you can use "g<LeftMouse>" to
jump to tags).

Whether the selection that is started with the mouse is in Visual mode or
Select mode depends on whether "mouse" is included in the 'selectmode'
option.

In an xterm, with the currently active mode included in the 'mouse' option,
normal mouse clicks are used by Vim, mouse clicks with the shift or ctrl key
pressed go to the xterm.  With the currently active mode not included in
'mouse' all mouse clicks go to the xterm.

							*xterm-clipboard*
In the Athena and Motif GUI versions, when running in a terminal and there is
access to the X-server (DISPLAY is set), the copy and paste will behave like
in the GUI.  If not, the middle mouse button will insert the unnamed register.
In that case, here is how you copy and paste a piece of text:

Copy/paste with the mouse and Visual mode ('mouse' option must be set, see
above):
1. Press left mouse button on first letter of text, move mouse pointer to last
   letter of the text and release the button.  This will start Visual mode and
   highlight the selected area.
2. Press "y" to yank the Visual text in the unnamed register.
3. Click the left mouse button at the insert position.
4. Click the middle mouse button.

Shortcut: If the insert position is on the screen at the same time as the
Visual text, you can do 2, 3 and 4 all in one: Click the middle mouse button
at the insert position.

Note: When the |-X| command line argument is used, Vim will not connect to the
X server and copy/paste to the X clipboard (selection) will not work.  Use the
shift key with the mouse buttons to let the xterm do the selection.

							*xterm-command-server*
When the X-server clipboard is available, the command server described in
|x11-clientserver| can be enabled with the --servername command line argument.

							*xterm-copy-paste*
NOTE: In some (older) xterms, it's not possible to move the cursor past column
95 or 223.  This is an xterm problem, not Vim's.  Get a newer xterm
|color-xterm|.  Also see |'ttymouse'|.

Copy/paste in xterm with (current mode NOT included in 'mouse'):
1. Press left mouse button on first letter of text, move mouse pointer to last
   letter of the text and release the button.
2. Use normal Vim commands to put the cursor at the insert position.
3. Press "a" to start Insert mode.
4. Click the middle mouse button.
5. Press ESC to end Insert mode.
(The same can be done with anything in 'mouse' if you keep the shift key
pressed while using the mouse.)

Note: if you lose the 8th bit when pasting (special characters are translated
into other characters), you may have to do "stty cs8 -istrip -parenb" in your
shell before starting Vim.

Thus in an xterm the shift and ctrl keys cannot be used with the mouse.  Mouse
commands requiring the CTRL modifier can be simulated by typing the "g" key
before using the mouse:
	"g<LeftMouse>"	is "<C-LeftMouse>	(jump to tag under mouse click)
	"g<RightMouse>" is "<C-RightMouse>	("CTRL-T")

					*mouse-mode-table* *mouse-overview*
A short overview of what the mouse buttons do, when 'mousemodel' is "extend":

Normal Mode:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<LeftMouse>     yes	     end	    yes
<C-LeftMouse>   yes	     end	    yes	   "CTRL-]" (2)
<S-LeftMouse>   yes	  no change	    yes	   "*" (2)    *<S-LeftMouse>*
<LeftDrag>      yes	start or extend (1) no		      *<LeftDrag>*
<LeftRelease>   yes	start or extend (1) no
<MiddleMouse>   yes	  if not active     no	   put
<MiddleMouse>   yes	  if active	    no	   yank and put
<RightMouse>    yes	start or extend     yes
<A-RightMouse>  yes start or extend blockw. yes		      *<A-RightMouse>*
<S-RightMouse>  yes	   no change	    yes	   "#" (2)    *<S-RightMouse>*
<C-RightMouse>  no	   no change	    no	   "CTRL-T"
<RightDrag>     yes	    extend	    no		      *<RightDrag>*
<RightRelease>  yes	    extend	    no		      *<RightRelease>*

Insert or Replace Mode:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<LeftMouse>     yes     (cannot be active)  yes
<C-LeftMouse>   yes     (cannot be active)  yes	   "CTRL-O^]" (2)
<S-LeftMouse>   yes     (cannot be active)  yes	   "CTRL-O*" (2)
<LeftDrag>      yes     start or extend (1) no	   like CTRL-O (1)
<LeftRelease>   yes     start or extend (1) no	   like CTRL-O (1)
<MiddleMouse>   no      (cannot be active)  no	   put register
<RightMouse>    yes     start or extend	    yes	   like CTRL-O
<A-RightMouse>  yes start or extend blockw. yes
<S-RightMouse>  yes     (cannot be active)  yes	   "CTRL-O#" (2)
<C-RightMouse>  no	(cannot be active)  no	   "CTRL-O CTRL-T"

In a help window:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<2-LeftMouse>   yes     (cannot be active)  no	   "^]" (jump to help tag)

When 'mousemodel' is "popup", these are different:

Normal Mode:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<S-LeftMouse>	yes	start or extend (1) no
<A-LeftMouse>   yes start or extend blockw. no		      *<A-LeftMouse>*
<RightMouse>	no	popup menu	    no

Insert or Replace Mode:
event	      position	   selection	  change  action	~
	       cursor			  window		~
<S-LeftMouse>   yes     start or extend (1) no	   like CTRL-O (1)
<A-LeftMouse>   yes start or extend blockw. no
<RightMouse>    no	popup menu	    no

(1) only if mouse pointer moved since press
(2) only if click is in same buffer

Clicking the left mouse button causes the cursor to be positioned.  If the
click is in another window that window is made the active window.  When
editing the command-line the cursor can only be positioned on the
command-line.  When in Insert mode Vim remains in Insert mode.  If 'scrolloff'
is set, and the cursor is positioned within 'scrolloff' lines from the window
border, the text is scrolled.

A selection can be started by pressing the left mouse button on the first
character, moving the mouse to the last character, then releasing the mouse
button.  You will not always see the selection until you release the button,
only in some versions (GUI, MS-DOS, WIN32) will the dragging be shown
immediately.  Note that you can make the text scroll by moving the mouse at
least one character in the first/last line in the window when 'scrolloff' is
non-zero.

In Normal, Visual and Select mode clicking the right mouse button causes the
Visual area to be extended.  When 'mousemodel' is "popup", the left button has
to be used while keeping the shift key pressed.  When clicking in a window
which is editing another buffer, the Visual or Select mode is stopped.

In Normal, Visual and Select mode clicking the right mouse button with the alt
key pressed causes the Visual area to become blockwise.  When 'mousemodel' is
"popup" the left button has to be used with the alt key.  Note that this won't
work on systems where the window manager consumes the mouse events when the
alt key is pressed (it may move the window).

							*double-click*
Double, triple and quadruple clicks are supported when the GUI is active,
for MS-DOS and Win32, and for an xterm (if the gettimeofday() function is
available).  For selecting text, extra clicks extend the selection:
	click		select ~
	double		word or % match		*<2-LeftMouse>*
	triple		line			*<3-LeftMouse>*
	quadruple	rectangular block	*<4-LeftMouse>*
Exception: In a Help window a double click jumps to help for the word that is
clicked on.
A double click on a word selects that word.  'iskeyword' is used to specify
which characters are included in a word.  A double click on a character
that has a match selects until that match (like using "v%").  If the match is
an #if/#else/#endif block, the selection becomes linewise.
For MS-DOS and xterm the time for double clicking can be set with the
'mousetime' option.  For the other systems this time is defined outside of
Vim.
An example, for using a double click to jump to the tag under the cursor: >
	:map <2-LeftMouse> :exe "tag ". expand("<cword>")<CR>

Dragging the mouse with a double click (button-down, button-up, button-down
and then drag) will result in whole words to be selected.  This continues
until the button is released, at which point the selection is per character
again.

							*gpm-mouse*
The GPM mouse is only supported when the |+mouse_gpm| feature was enabled at
compile time.  The GPM mouse driver (Linux console) does not support quadruple
clicks.

In Insert mode, when a selection is started, Vim goes into Normal mode
temporarily.  When Visual or Select mode ends, it returns to Insert mode.
This is like using CTRL-O in Insert mode.  Select mode is used when the
'selectmode' option contains "mouse".
							*sysmouse*
The sysmouse is only supported when the |+mouse_sysmouse| feature was enabled
at compile time.  The sysmouse driver (*BSD console) does not support keyboard
modifiers.

							*drag-status-line*
When working with several windows, the size of the windows can be changed by
dragging the status line with the mouse.  Point the mouse at a status line,
press the left button, move the mouse to the new position of the status line,
release the button.  Just clicking the mouse in a status line makes that window
the current window, without moving the cursor.  If by selecting a window it
will change position or size, the dragging of the status line will look
confusing, but it will work (just try it).

					*<MiddleRelease>* *<MiddleDrag>*
Mouse clicks can be mapped.  The codes for mouse clicks are:
     code	    mouse button	      normal action	~
 <LeftMouse>	 left pressed		    set cursor position
 <LeftDrag>	 left moved while pressed   extend selection
 <LeftRelease>	 left released		    set selection end
 <MiddleMouse>	 middle pressed		    paste text at cursor position
 <MiddleDrag>	 middle moved while pressed -
 <MiddleRelease> middle released	    -
 <RightMouse>	 right pressed		    extend selection
 <RightDrag>	 right moved while pressed  extend selection
 <RightRelease>  right released		    set selection end
 <X1Mouse>	 X1 button pressed	    -			*X1Mouse*
 <X1Drag>	 X1 moved while pressed	    -			*X1Drag*
 <X1Release>	 X1 button release	    -			*X1Release*
 <X2Mouse>	 X2 button pressed	    -			*X2Mouse*
 <X2Drag>	 X2 moved while pressed     -			*X2Drag*
 <X2Release>	 X2 button release	    -			*X2Release*

The X1 and X2 buttons refer to the extra buttons found on some mice.  The
'Microsoft Explorer' mouse has these buttons available to the right thumb.
Currently X1 and X2 only work on Win32 and X11 environments.

Examples: >
	:noremap <MiddleMouse> <LeftMouse><MiddleMouse>
Paste at the position of the middle mouse button click (otherwise the paste
would be done at the cursor position). >

	:noremap <LeftRelease> <LeftRelease>y
Immediately yank the selection, when using Visual mode.

Note the use of ":noremap" instead of "map" to avoid a recursive mapping.
>
	:map <X1Mouse> <C-O>
	:map <X2Mouse> <C-I>
Map the X1 and X2 buttons to go forwards and backwards in the jump list, see
|CTRL-O| and |CTRL-I|.

						*mouse-swap-buttons*
To swap the meaning of the left and right mouse buttons: >
	:noremap	<LeftMouse>	<RightMouse>
	:noremap	<LeftDrag>	<RightDrag>
	:noremap	<LeftRelease>	<RightRelease>
	:noremap	<RightMouse>	<LeftMouse>
	:noremap	<RightDrag>	<LeftDrag>
	:noremap	<RightRelease>	<LeftRelease>
	:noremap	g<LeftMouse>	<C-RightMouse>
	:noremap	g<RightMouse>	<C-LeftMouse>
	:noremap!	<LeftMouse>	<RightMouse>
	:noremap!	<LeftDrag>	<RightDrag>
	:noremap!	<LeftRelease>	<RightRelease>
	:noremap!	<RightMouse>	<LeftMouse>
	:noremap!	<RightDrag>	<LeftDrag>
	:noremap!	<RightRelease>	<LeftRelease>

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Digraphs					*digraph* *digraphs* *Digraphs*

Digraphs are used to enter characters that normally cannot be entered by
an ordinary keyboard.  These are mostly printable non-ASCII characters.  The
digraphs are easier to remember than the decimal number that can be entered
with CTRL-V (see |i_CTRL-V|).

There is a brief introduction on digraphs in the user manual: |24.9|
An alternative is using the 'keymap' option.

1. Defining digraphs	|digraphs-define|
2. Using digraphs	|digraphs-use|
3. Default digraphs	|digraphs-default|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Defining digraphs					*digraphs-define*

						*:dig* *:digraphs*
:dig[raphs]		show currently defined digraphs.
							*E104* *E39*
:dig[raphs] {char1}{char2} {number} ...
			Add digraph {char1}{char2} to the list.  {number} is
			the decimal representation of the character.  Normally
			it is the Unicode character, see |digraph-encoding|.
			Example: >
	:digr e: 235 a: 228
<			Avoid defining a digraph with '_' (underscore) as the
			first character, it has a special meaning in the
			future.

Vim is normally compiled with the |+digraphs| feature.  If the feature is
disabled, the ":digraph" command will display an error message.

Example of the output of ":digraphs": >
 TH   222  ss   223  a!   224  a'   225  a>   226  a?   227  a:   228

The first two characters in each column are the characters you have to type to
enter the digraph.

In the middle of each column is the resulting character.  This may be mangled
if you look at it on a system that does not support digraphs or if you print
this file.

							*digraph-encoding*
The decimal number normally is the Unicode number of the character.  Note that
the meaning doesn't change when 'encoding' changes.  The character will be
converted from Unicode to 'encoding' when needed.  This does require the
conversion to be available, it might fail.  For the NUL character you will see
"10".  That's because NUL characters are internally represented with a NL
character.  When you write the file it will become a NUL character.

When Vim was compiled without the |+multi_byte| feature, you need to specify
the character in the encoding given with 'encoding'.  You might want to use
something like this: >

	if has("multi_byte")
		digraph oe 339
	elseif &encoding == "iso-8859-15"
		digraph oe 189
	endif

This defines the "oe" digraph for a character that is number 339 in Unicode
and 189 in latin9 (iso-8859-15).

==============================================================================
2. Using digraphs					*digraphs-use*

There are two methods to enter digraphs:			*i_digraph*
	CTRL-K {char1} {char2}		or
	{char1} <BS> {char2}
The first is always available; the second only when the 'digraph' option is
set.

If a digraph with {char1}{char2} does not exist, Vim searches for a digraph
{char2}{char1}.  This helps when you don't remember which character comes
first.

Note that when you enter CTRL-K {char1}, where {char1} is a special key, Vim
enters the code for that special key.  This is not a digraph.

Once you have entered the digraph, Vim treats the character like a normal
character that occupies only one character in the file and on the screen.
Example: >
	'B' <BS> 'B'	will enter the broken '|' character (166)
	'a' <BS> '>'	will enter an 'a' with a circumflex (226)
	CTRL-K '-' '-'	will enter a soft hyphen (173)

The current digraphs are listed with the ":digraphs" command.  Some of the
default ones are listed below |digraph-table|.

For CTRL-K, there is one general digraph: CTRL-K <Space> {char} will enter
{char} with the highest bit set.  You can use this to enter meta-characters.

The <Esc> character cannot be part of a digraph.  When hitting <Esc>, Vim
stops digraph entry and ends Insert mode or Command-line mode, just like
hitting an <Esc> out of digraph context.  Use CTRL-V 155 to enter meta-ESC
(CSI).

If you accidentally typed an 'a' that should be an 'e', you will type 'a' <BS>
'e'.  But that is a digraph, so you will not get what you want.  To correct
this, you will have to type <BS> e again.  To avoid this don't set the
'digraph' option and use CTRL-K to enter digraphs.

You may have problems using Vim with characters which have a value above 128.
For example: You insert ue (u-umlaut) and the editor echoes \334 in Insert
mode.  After leaving the Insert mode everything is fine.  Note that fmt
removes all characters with a value above 128 from the text being formatted.
On some Unix systems this means you have to define the environment-variable
LC_CTYPE.  If you are using csh, then put the following line in your .cshrc: >
	setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1

==============================================================================
3. Default digraphs					*digraphs-default*

Vim comes with a set of default digraphs.  Check the output of ":digraphs" to
see them.

On most systems Vim uses the same digraphs.  They work for the Unicode and
ISO-8859-1 character sets.  These default digraphs are taken from the RFC1345
mnemonics.  To make it easy to remember the mnemonic, the second character has
a standard meaning:

	char name		char	meaning ~
	Exclamation mark	!	Grave
	Apostrophe		'	Acute accent
	Greater-Than sign	>	Circumflex accent
	Question mark		?	Tilde
	Hyphen-Minus		-	Macron
	Left parenthesis	(	Breve
	Full stop		.	Dot above
	Colon			:	Diaeresis
	Comma			,	Cedilla
	Underline		_	Underline
	Solidus			/	Stroke
	Quotation mark		"	Double acute accent
	Semicolon		;	Ogonek
	Less-Than sign		<	Caron
	Zero			0	Ring above
	Two			2	Hook
	Nine			9	Horn

	Equals			=	Cyrillic (= used as second char)
	Asterisk		*	Greek
	Percent sign		%	Greek/Cyrillic special
	Plus			+	smalls: Arabic, capitals: Hebrew
	Three			3	some Latin/Greek/Cyrillic letters
	Four			4	Bopomofo
	Five			5	Hiragana
	Six			6	Katakana

Example: a: is   and o: is 

These are the RFC1345 digraphs for the one-byte characters.  See the output of
":digraphs" for the others.  The characters above 255 are only available when
Vim was compiled with the |+multi_byte| feature.

EURO

Exception: RFC1345 doesn't specify the euro sign.  In Vim the digraph =e was
added for this.  Note the difference between latin1, where the digraph Cu is
used for the currency sign, and latin9 (iso-8859-15), where the digraph =e is
used for the euro sign, while both of them are the character 164, 0xa4.  For
compatibility with zsh Eu can also be used for the euro sign.

ROUBLE

The rouble sign was added in 2014 as 0x20bd.  Vim supports the digraphs =R and
=P for this.  Note that R= and P= are other characters.

Multi-byte support				*multibyte* *multi-byte*
						*Chinese* *Japanese* *Korean*
This is about editing text in languages which have many characters that can
not be represented using one byte (one octet).  Examples are Chinese, Japanese
and Korean.  Unicode is also covered here.

For an introduction to the most common features, see |usr_45.txt| in the user
manual.
For changing the language of messages and menus see |mlang.txt|.

==============================================================================
1. Getting started					*mbyte-first*

This is a summary of the multibyte features in Vim.  If you are lucky it works
as described and you can start using Vim without much trouble.  If something
doesn't work you will have to read the rest.  Don't be surprised if it takes
quite a bit of work and experimenting to make Vim use all the multi-byte
features.  Unfortunately, every system has its own way to deal with multibyte
languages and it is quite complicated.


COMPILING

If you already have a compiled Vim program, check if the |+multi_byte| feature
is included.  The |:version| command can be used for this.

If +multi_byte is not included, you should compile Vim with "normal", "big" or
"huge" features.  You can further tune what features are included.  See the
INSTALL files in the source directory.


LOCALE

First of all, you must make sure your current locale is set correctly.  If
your system has been installed to use the language, it probably works right
away.  If not, you can often make it work by setting the $LANG environment
variable in your shell: >

	setenv LANG ja_JP.EUC

Unfortunately, the name of the locale depends on your system.  Japanese might
also be called "ja_JP.EUCjp" or just "ja".  To see what is currently used: >

	:language

To change the locale inside Vim use: >

	:language ja_JP.EUC

Vim will give an error message if this doesn't work.  This is a good way to
experiment and find the locale name you want to use.  But it's always better
to set the locale in the shell, so that it is used right from the start.

See |mbyte-locale| for details.


ENCODING

If your locale works properly, Vim will try to set the 'encoding' option
accordingly.  If this doesn't work you can overrule its value: >

	:set encoding=utf-8

See |encoding-values| for a list of acceptable values.

The result is that all the text that is used inside Vim will be in this
encoding.  Not only the text in the buffers, but also in registers, variables,
etc.  This also means that changing the value of 'encoding' makes the existing
text invalid!  The text doesn't change, but it will be displayed wrong.

You can edit files in another encoding than what 'encoding' is set to.  Vim
will convert the file when you read it and convert it back when you write it.
See 'fileencoding', 'fileencodings' and |++enc|.


DISPLAY AND FONTS

If you are working in a terminal (emulator) you must make sure it accepts the
same encoding as which Vim is working with.  If this is not the case, you can
use the 'termencoding' option to make Vim convert text automatically.

For the GUI you must select fonts that work with the current 'encoding'.  This
is the difficult part.  It depends on the system you are using, the locale and
a few other things.  See the chapters on fonts: |mbyte-fonts-X11| for
X-Windows and |mbyte-fonts-MSwin| for MS-Windows.

For GTK+ 2, you can skip most of this section.  The option 'guifontset' does
no longer exist.  You only need to set 'guifont' and everything should "just
work".  If your system comes with Xft2 and fontconfig and the current font
does not contain a certain glyph, a different font will be used automatically
if available.  The 'guifontwide' option is still supported but usually you do
not need to set it.  It is only necessary if the automatic font selection does
not suit your needs.

For X11 you can set the 'guifontset' option to a list of fonts that together
cover the characters that are used.  Example for Korean: >

	:set guifontset=k12,r12

Alternatively, you can set 'guifont' and 'guifontwide'.  'guifont' is used for
the single-width characters, 'guifontwide' for the double-width characters.
Thus the 'guifontwide' font must be exactly twice as wide as 'guifont'.
Example for UTF-8: >

	:set guifont=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-18-120-100-100-c-90-iso10646-1
	:set guifontwide=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-18-120-100-100-c-180-iso10646-1

You can also set 'guifont' alone, Vim will try to find a matching
'guifontwide' for you.


INPUT

There are several ways to enter multi-byte characters:
- For X11 XIM can be used.  See |XIM|.
- For MS-Windows IME can be used.  See |IME|.
- For all systems keymaps can be used.  See |mbyte-keymap|.

The options 'iminsert', 'imsearch' and 'imcmdline' can be used to chose
the different input methods or disable them temporarily.

==============================================================================
2.  Locale						*mbyte-locale*

The easiest setup is when your whole system uses the locale you want to work
in.  But it's also possible to set the locale for one shell you are working
in, or just use a certain locale inside Vim.


WHAT IS A LOCALE?					*locale*

There are many of languages in the world.  And there are different cultures
and environments at least as much as the number of languages.	A linguistic
environment corresponding to an area is called "locale".  This includes
information about the used language, the charset, collating order for sorting,
date format, currency format and so on.  For Vim only the language and charset
really matter.

You can only use a locale if your system has support for it.  Some systems
have only a few locales, especially in the USA.  The language which you want
to use may not be on your system.  In that case you might be able to install
it as an extra package.  Check your system documentation for how to do that.

The location in which the locales are installed varies from system to system.
For example, "/usr/share/locale" or "/usr/lib/locale".  See your system's
setlocale() man page.

Looking in these directories will show you the exact name of each locale.
Mostly upper/lowercase matters, thus "ja_JP.EUC" and "ja_jp.euc" are
different.  Some systems have a locale.alias file, which allows translation
from a short name like "nl" to the full name "nl_NL.ISO_8859-1".

Note that X-windows has its own locale stuff.  And unfortunately uses locale
names different from what is used elsewhere.  This is confusing!  For Vim it
matters what the setlocale() function uses, which is generally NOT the
X-windows stuff.  You might have to do some experiments to find out what
really works.

							*locale-name*
The (simplified) format of |locale| name is:

	language
or	language_territory
or	language_territory.codeset

Territory means the country (or part of it), codeset means the |charset|.  For
example, the locale name "ja_JP.eucJP" means:
	ja	the language is Japanese
	JP	the country is Japan
	eucJP	the codeset is EUC-JP
But it also could be "ja", "ja_JP.EUC", "ja_JP.ujis", etc.  And unfortunately,
the locale name for a specific language, territory and codeset is not unified
and depends on your system.

Examples of locale name:
    charset	    language		  locale name ~
    GB2312	    Chinese (simplified)  zh_CN.EUC, zh_CN.GB2312
    Big5	    Chinese (traditional) zh_TW.BIG5, zh_TW.Big5
    CNS-11643	    Chinese (traditional) zh_TW
    EUC-JP	    Japanese		  ja, ja_JP.EUC, ja_JP.ujis, ja_JP.eucJP
    Shift_JIS	    Japanese		  ja_JP.SJIS, ja_JP.Shift_JIS
    EUC-KR	    Korean		  ko, ko_KR.EUC


USING A LOCALE

To start using a locale for the whole system, see the documentation of your
system.  Mostly you need to set it in a configuration file in "/etc".

To use a locale in a shell, set the $LANG environment value.  When you want to
use Korean and the |locale| name is "ko", do this:

    sh:    export LANG=ko
    csh:   setenv LANG ko

You can put this in your ~/.profile or ~/.cshrc file to always use it.

To use a locale in Vim only, use the |:language| command: >

	:language ko

Put this in your ~/.vimrc file to use it always.

Or specify $LANG when starting Vim:

   sh:    LANG=ko vim {vim-arguments}
   csh:	  env LANG=ko vim {vim-arguments}

You could make a small shell script for this.

==============================================================================
3.  Encoding				*mbyte-encoding*

Vim uses the 'encoding' option to specify how characters are identified and
encoded when they are used inside Vim.  This applies to all the places where
text is used, including buffers (files loaded into memory), registers and
variables.

							*charset* *codeset*
Charset is another name for encoding.  There are subtle differences, but these
don't matter when using Vim.  "codeset" is another similar name.

Each character is encoded as one or more bytes.  When all characters are
encoded with one byte, we call this a single-byte encoding.  The most often
used one is called "latin1".  This limits the number of characters to 256.
Some of these are control characters, thus even fewer can be used for text.

When some characters use two or more bytes, we call this a multi-byte
encoding.  This allows using much more than 256 characters, which is required
for most East Asian languages.

Most multi-byte encodings use one byte for the first 127 characters.  These
are equal to ASCII, which makes it easy to exchange plain-ASCII text, no
matter what language is used.  Thus you might see the right text even when the
encoding was set wrong.

							*encoding-names*
Vim can use many different character encodings.  There are three major groups:

1   8bit	Single-byte encodings, 256 different characters.  Mostly used
		in USA and Europe.  Example: ISO-8859-1 (Latin1).  All
		characters occupy one screen cell only.

2   2byte	Double-byte encodings, over 10000 different characters.
		Mostly used in Asian countries.  Example: euc-kr (Korean)
		The number of screen cells is equal to the number of bytes
		(except for euc-jp when the first byte is 0x8e).

u   Unicode	Universal encoding, can replace all others.  ISO 10646.
		Millions of different characters.  Example: UTF-8.  The
		relation between bytes and screen cells is complex.

Other encodings cannot be used by Vim internally.  But files in other
encodings can be edited by using conversion, see 'fileencoding'.
Note that all encodings must use ASCII for the characters up to 128 (except
when compiled for EBCDIC).

Supported 'encoding' values are:			*encoding-values*
1   latin1	8-bit characters (ISO 8859-1, also used for cp1252)
1   iso-8859-n	ISO_8859 variant (n = 2 to 15)
1   koi8-r	Russian
1   koi8-u	Ukrainian
1   macroman    MacRoman (Macintosh encoding)
1   8bit-{name} any 8-bit encoding (Vim specific name)
1   cp437	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp737	similar to iso-8859-7
1   cp775	Baltic
1   cp850	similar to iso-8859-4
1   cp852	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp855	similar to iso-8859-2
1   cp857	similar to iso-8859-5
1   cp860	similar to iso-8859-9
1   cp861	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp862	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp863	similar to iso-8859-8
1   cp865	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp866	similar to iso-8859-5
1   cp869	similar to iso-8859-7
1   cp874	Thai
1   cp1250	Czech, Polish, etc.
1   cp1251	Cyrillic
1   cp1253	Greek
1   cp1254	Turkish
1   cp1255	Hebrew
1   cp1256	Arabic
1   cp1257	Baltic
1   cp1258	Vietnamese
1   cp{number}	MS-Windows: any installed single-byte codepage
2   cp932	Japanese (Windows only)
2   euc-jp	Japanese (Unix only)
2   sjis	Japanese (Unix only)
2   cp949	Korean (Unix and Windows)
2   euc-kr	Korean (Unix only)
2   cp936	simplified Chinese (Windows only)
2   euc-cn	simplified Chinese (Unix only)
2   cp950	traditional Chinese (on Unix alias for big5)
2   big5	traditional Chinese (on Windows alias for cp950)
2   euc-tw	traditional Chinese (Unix only)
2   2byte-{name} Unix: any double-byte encoding (Vim specific name)
2   cp{number}	MS-Windows: any installed double-byte codepage
u   utf-8	32 bit UTF-8 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-2	16 bit UCS-2 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-2le	like ucs-2, little endian
u   utf-16	ucs-2 extended with double-words for more characters
u   utf-16le	like utf-16, little endian
u   ucs-4	32 bit UCS-4 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-4le	like ucs-4, little endian

The {name} can be any encoding name that your system supports.  It is passed
to iconv() to convert between the encoding of the file and the current locale.
For MS-Windows "cp{number}" means using codepage {number}.
Examples: >
		:set encoding=8bit-cp1252
		:set encoding=2byte-cp932

The MS-Windows codepage 1252 is very similar to latin1.  For practical reasons
the same encoding is used and it's called latin1.  'isprint' can be used to
display the characters 0x80 - 0xA0 or not.

Several aliases can be used, they are translated to one of the names above.
An incomplete list:

1   ansi	same as latin1 (obsolete, for backward compatibility)
2   japan	Japanese: on Unix "euc-jp", on MS-Windows cp932
2   korea	Korean: on Unix "euc-kr", on MS-Windows cp949
2   prc		simplified Chinese: on Unix "euc-cn", on MS-Windows cp936
2   chinese     same as "prc"
2   taiwan	traditional Chinese: on Unix "euc-tw", on MS-Windows cp950
u   utf8	same as utf-8
u   unicode	same as ucs-2
u   ucs2be	same as ucs-2 (big endian)
u   ucs-2be	same as ucs-2 (big endian)
u   ucs-4be	same as ucs-4 (big endian)
u   utf-32	same as ucs-4
u   utf-32le	same as ucs-4le
    default     stands for the default value of 'encoding', depends on the
		environment

For the UCS codes the byte order matters.  This is tricky, use UTF-8 whenever
you can.  The default is to use big-endian (most significant byte comes
first):
	    name	bytes		char ~
	    ucs-2	      11 22	    1122
	    ucs-2le	      22 11	    1122
	    ucs-4	11 22 33 44	11223344
	    ucs-4le	44 33 22 11	11223344

On MS-Windows systems you often want to use "ucs-2le", because it uses little
endian UCS-2.

There are a few encodings which are similar, but not exactly the same.  Vim
treats them as if they were different encodings, so that conversion will be
done when needed.  You might want to use the similar name to avoid conversion
or when conversion is not possible:

	cp932, shift-jis, sjis
	cp936, euc-cn

							*encoding-table*
Normally 'encoding' is equal to your current locale and 'termencoding' is
empty.  This means that your keyboard and display work with characters encoded
in your current locale, and Vim uses the same characters internally.

You can make Vim use characters in a different encoding by setting the
'encoding' option to a different value.  Since the keyboard and display still
use the current locale, conversion needs to be done.  The 'termencoding' then
takes over the value of the current locale, so Vim converts between 'encoding'
and 'termencoding'.  Example: >
	:let &termencoding = &encoding
	:set encoding=utf-8

However, not all combinations of values are possible.  The table below tells
you how each of the nine combinations works.  This is further restricted by
not all conversions being possible, iconv() being present, etc.  Since this
depends on the system used, no detailed list can be given.

('tenc' is the short name for 'termencoding' and 'enc' short for 'encoding')

'tenc'	    'enc'	remark ~

 8bit	    8bit	Works.  When 'termencoding' is different from
			'encoding' typing and displaying may be wrong for some
			characters, Vim does NOT perform conversion (set
			'encoding' to "utf-8" to get this).
 8bit      2byte	MS-Windows: works for all codepages installed on your
			system; you can only type 8bit characters;
			Other systems: does NOT work.
 8bit	   Unicode	Works, but only 8bit characters can be typed directly
			(others through digraphs, keymaps, etc.); in a
			terminal you can only see 8bit characters; the GUI can
			show all characters that the 'guifont' supports.

 2byte	    8bit	Works, but typing non-ASCII characters might
			be a problem.
 2byte	   2byte	MS-Windows: works for all codepages installed on your
			system; typing characters might be a problem when
			locale is different from 'encoding'.
			Other systems: Only works when 'termencoding' is equal
			to 'encoding', you might as well leave it empty.
 2byte	   Unicode	works, Vim will translate typed characters.

 Unicode    8bit	works (unusual)
 Unicode    2byte	does NOT work
 Unicode   Unicode	works very well (leaving 'termencoding' empty works
			the same way, because all Unicode is handled
			internally as UTF-8)

CONVERSION						*charset-conversion*

Vim will automatically convert from one to another encoding in several places:
- When reading a file and 'fileencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When writing a file and 'fileencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When displaying characters and 'termencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When reading input and 'termencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When displaying messages and the encoding used for LC_MESSAGES differs from
  'encoding' (requires a gettext version that supports this).
- When reading a Vim script where |:scriptencoding| is different from
  'encoding'.
- When reading or writing a |viminfo| file.
Most of these require the |+iconv| feature.  Conversion for reading and
writing files may also be specified with the 'charconvert' option.

Useful utilities for converting the charset:
    All:	    iconv
	GNU iconv can convert most encodings.  Unicode is used as the
	intermediate encoding, which allows conversion from and to all other
	encodings.  See http://www.gnu.org/directory/libiconv.html.

    Japanese:	    nkf
	Nkf is "Network Kanji code conversion Filter".  One of the most unique
	facility of nkf is the guess of the input Kanji code.  So, you don't
	need to know what the inputting file's |charset| is.  When convert to
	EUC-JP from ISO-2022-JP or Shift_JIS, simply do the following command
	in Vim:
	    :%!nkf -e
	Nkf can be found at:
	http://www.sfc.wide.ad.jp/~max/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/nkf-1.62.tar.gz

    Chinese:	    hc
	Hc is "Hanzi Converter".  Hc convert a GB file to a Big5 file, or Big5
	file to GB file.  Hc can be found at:
	ftp://ftp.cuhk.hk/pub/chinese/ifcss/software/unix/convert/hc-30.tar.gz

    Korean:	    hmconv
	Hmconv is Korean code conversion utility especially for E-mail.  It can
	convert between EUC-KR and ISO-2022-KR.  Hmconv can be found at:
	ftp://ftp.kaist.ac.kr/pub/hangul/code/hmconv/

    Multilingual:   lv
	Lv is a Powerful Multilingual File Viewer.  And it can be worked as
	|charset| converter.  Supported |charset|: ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-JP,
	ISO-2022-KR, EUC-CN, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, EUC-TW, UTF-7, UTF-8, ISO-8859
	series, Shift_JIS, Big5 and HZ.  Lv can be found at:
	http://www.ff.iij4u.or.jp/~nrt/lv/index.html


							*mbyte-conversion*
When reading and writing files in an encoding different from 'encoding',
conversion needs to be done.  These conversions are supported:
- All conversions between Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), UTF-8, UCS-2 and UCS-4 are
  handled internally.
- For MS-Windows, when 'encoding' is a Unicode encoding, conversion from and
  to any codepage should work.
- Conversion specified with 'charconvert'
- Conversion with the iconv library, if it is available.
	Old versions of GNU iconv() may cause the conversion to fail (they
	request a very large buffer, more than Vim is willing to provide).
	Try getting another iconv() implementation.

							*iconv-dynamic*
On MS-Windows Vim can be compiled with the |+iconv/dyn| feature.  This means
Vim will search for the "iconv.dll" and "libiconv.dll" libraries.  When
neither of them can be found Vim will still work but some conversions won't be
possible.

==============================================================================
4. Using a terminal					*mbyte-terminal*

The GUI fully supports multi-byte characters.  It is also possible in a
terminal, if the terminal supports the same encoding that Vim uses.  Thus this
is less flexible.

For example, you can run Vim in a xterm with added multi-byte support and/or
|XIM|.  Examples are kterm (Kanji term) and hanterm (for Korean), Eterm
(Enlightened terminal) and rxvt.

If your terminal does not support the right encoding, you can set the
'termencoding' option.  Vim will then convert the typed characters from
'termencoding' to 'encoding'.  And displayed text will be converted from
'encoding' to 'termencoding'.  If the encoding supported by the terminal
doesn't include all the characters that Vim uses, this leads to lost
characters.  This may mess up the display.  If you use a terminal that
supports Unicode, such as the xterm mentioned below, it should work just fine,
since nearly every character set can be converted to Unicode without loss of
information.


UTF-8 IN XFREE86 XTERM					*UTF8-xterm*

This is a short explanation of how to use UTF-8 character encoding in the
xterm that comes with XFree86 by Thomas Dickey (text by Markus Kuhn).

Get the latest xterm version which has now UTF-8 support:

	http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html

Compile it with "./configure --enable-wide-chars ; make"

Also get the ISO 10646-1 version of various fonts, which is available on

	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts.tar.gz

and install the font as described in the README file.

Now start xterm with >

  xterm -u8 -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso10646-1
or, for bigger character: >
  xterm -u8 -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1

and you will have a working UTF-8 terminal emulator.  Try both >

   cat utf-8-demo.txt
   vim utf-8-demo.txt

with the demo text that comes with ucs-fonts.tar.gz in order to see
whether there are any problems with UTF-8 in your xterm.

For Vim you may need to set 'encoding' to "utf-8".

==============================================================================
5.  Fonts on X11					*mbyte-fonts-X11*

Unfortunately, using fonts in X11 is complicated.  The name of a single-byte
font is a long string.  For multi-byte fonts we need several of these...

Note: Most of this is no longer relevant for GTK+ 2.  Selecting a font via
its XLFD is not supported; see 'guifont' for an example of how to
set the font.  Do yourself a favor and ignore the |XLFD| and |xfontset|
sections below.

First of all, Vim only accepts fixed-width fonts for displaying text.  You
cannot use proportionally spaced fonts.  This excludes many of the available
(and nicer looking) fonts.  However, for menus and tooltips any font can be
used.

Note that Display and Input are independent.  It is possible to see your
language even though you have no input method for it.

You should get a default font for menus and tooltips that works, but it might
be ugly.  Read the following to find out how to select a better font.


X LOGICAL FONT DESCRIPTION (XLFD)
							*XLFD*
XLFD is the X font name and contains the information about the font size,
charset, etc.  The name is in this format:

FOUNDRY-FAMILY-WEIGHT-SLANT-WIDTH-STYLE-PIXEL-POINT-X-Y-SPACE-AVE-CR-CE

Each field means:

- FOUNDRY:  FOUNDRY field.  The company that created the font.
- FAMILY:   FAMILY_NAME field.  Basic font family name.  (helvetica, gothic,
	    times, etc)
- WEIGHT:   WEIGHT_NAME field.  How thick the letters are.  (light, medium,
	    bold, etc)
- SLANT:    SLANT field.
		r:  Roman (no slant)
		i:  Italic
		o:  Oblique
		ri: Reverse Italic
		ro: Reverse Oblique
		ot: Other
		number:	Scaled font
- WIDTH:    SETWIDTH_NAME field.  Width of characters.  (normal, condensed,
	    narrow, double wide)
- STYLE:    ADD_STYLE_NAME field.  Extra info to describe font.  (Serif, Sans
	    Serif, Informal, Decorated, etc)
- PIXEL:    PIXEL_SIZE field.  Height, in pixels, of characters.
- POINT:    POINT_SIZE field.  Ten times height of characters in points.
- X:	    RESOLUTION_X field.  X resolution (dots per inch).
- Y:	    RESOLUTION_Y field.  Y resolution (dots per inch).
- SPACE:    SPACING field.
		p:  Proportional
		m:  Monospaced
		c:  CharCell
- AVE:	    AVERAGE_WIDTH field.  Ten times average width in pixels.
- CR:	    CHARSET_REGISTRY field.  The name of the charset group.
- CE:	    CHARSET_ENCODING field.  The rest of the charset name.  For some
	    charsets, such as JIS X 0208, if this field is 0, code points has
	    the same value as GL, and GR if 1.

For example, in case of a 16 dots font corresponding to JIS X 0208, it is
written like:
    -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-110-100-100-c-160-jisx0208.1990-0


X FONTSET
						*fontset* *xfontset*
A single-byte charset is typically associated with one font.  For multi-byte
charsets a combination of fonts is often used.  This means that one group of
characters are used from one font and another group from another font (which
might be double wide).  This collection of fonts is called a fontset.

Which fonts are required in a fontset depends on the current locale.  X
windows maintains a table of which groups of characters are required for a
locale.  You have to specify all the fonts that a locale requires in the
'guifontset' option.

NOTE: The fontset always uses the current locale, even though 'encoding' may
be set to use a different charset.  In that situation you might want to use
'guifont' and 'guifontwide' instead of 'guifontset'.

Example:
    |charset| language		    "groups of characters" ~
    GB2312    Chinese (simplified)  ISO-8859-1 and GB 2312
    Big5      Chinese (traditional) ISO-8859-1 and Big5
    CNS-11643 Chinese (traditional) ISO-8859-1, CNS 11643-1 and CNS 11643-2
    EUC-JP    Japanese		    JIS X 0201 and JIS X 0208
    EUC-KR    Korean		    ISO-8859-1 and KS C 5601 (KS X 1001)

You can search for fonts using the xlsfonts command.  For example, when you're
searching for a font for KS C 5601: >
    xlsfonts | grep ksc5601

This is complicated and confusing.  You might want to consult the X-Windows
documentation if there is something you don't understand.

						*base_font_name_list*
When you have found the names of the fonts you want to use, you need to set
the 'guifontset' option.  You specify the list by concatenating the font names
and putting a comma in between them.

For example, when you use the ja_JP.eucJP locale, this requires JIS X 0201
and JIS X 0208.  You could supply a list of fonts that explicitly specifies
the charsets, like: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140-jisx0208.1983-0,
	\-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70-jisx0201.1976-0

Alternatively, you can supply a base font name list that omits the charset
name, letting X-Windows select font characters required for the locale.  For
example: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140,
	\-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70

Alternatively, you can supply a single base font name that allows X-Windows to
select from all available fonts.  For example: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*

Alternatively, you can specify alias names.  See the fonts.alias file in the
fonts directory (e.g., /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/).  For example: >

 :set guifontset=k14,r14
<
							*E253*
Note that in East Asian fonts, the standard character cell is square.  When
mixing a Latin font and an East Asian font, the East Asian font width should
be twice the Latin font width.

If 'guifontset' is not empty, the "font" argument of the |:highlight| command
is also interpreted as a fontset.  For example, you should use for
highlighting: >
	:hi Comment font=english_font,your_font
If you use a wrong "font" argument you will get an error message.
Also make sure that you set 'guifontset' before setting fonts for highlight
groups.


USING RESOURCE FILES

Instead of specifying 'guifontset', you can set X11 resources and Vim will
pick them up.  This is only for people who know how X resource files work.

For Motif and Athena insert these three lines in your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:

	Vim.font: |base_font_name_list|
	Vim*fontSet: |base_font_name_list|
	Vim*fontList: your_language_font

Note: Vim.font is for text area.
      Vim*fontSet is for menu.
      Vim*fontList is for menu (for Motif GUI)

For example, when you are using Japanese and a 14 dots font, >

	Vim.font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
	Vim*fontSet: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
	Vim*fontList: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
<
or: >

	Vim*font: k14,r14
	Vim*fontSet: k14,r14
	Vim*fontList: k14,r14
<
To have them take effect immediately you will have to do >

	xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults

Otherwise you will have to stop and restart the X server before the changes
take effect.


The GTK+ version of GUI Vim does not use .Xdefaults, use ~/.gtkrc instead.
The default mostly works OK.  But for the menus you might have to change
it.  Example: >

	style "default"
	{
		fontset="-*-*-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-c-*-*-*"
	}
	widget_class "*" style "default"

==============================================================================
6.  Fonts on MS-Windows				*mbyte-fonts-MSwin*

The simplest is to use the font dialog to select fonts and try them out.  You
can find this at the "Edit/Select Font..." menu.  Once you find a font name
that works well you can use this command to see its name: >

	:set guifont

Then add a command to your |gvimrc| file to set 'guifont': >

	:set guifont=courier_new:h12

==============================================================================
7.  Input on X11				*mbyte-XIM*

X INPUT METHOD (XIM) BACKGROUND			*XIM* *xim* *x-input-method*

XIM is an international input module for X.  There are two kinds of structures,
Xlib unit type and |IM-server| (Input-Method server) type.  |IM-server| type
is suitable for complex input, such as CJK.

- IM-server
							*IM-server*
  In |IM-server| type input structures, the input event is handled by either
  of the two ways: FrontEnd system and BackEnd system.  In the FrontEnd
  system, input events are snatched by the |IM-server| first, then |IM-server|
  give the application the result of input.  On the other hand, the BackEnd
  system works reverse order.  MS Windows adopt BackEnd system.  In X, most of
  |IM-server|s adopt FrontEnd system.  The demerit of BackEnd system is the
  large overhead in communication, but it provides safe synchronization with
  no restrictions on applications.

  For example, there are xwnmo and kinput2 Japanese |IM-server|, both are
  FrontEnd system.  Xwnmo is distributed with Wnn (see below), kinput2 can be
  found at: ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/x11/kinput2/

  For Chinese, there's a great XIM server named "xcin", you can input both
  Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters.  And it can accept other
  locale if you make a correct input table.  Xcin can be found at:
  http://cle.linux.org.tw/xcin/
  Others are scim: http://scim.freedesktop.org/ and fcitx:
  http://www.fcitx.org/

- Conversion Server
							*conversion-server*
  Some system needs additional server: conversion server.  Most of Japanese
  |IM-server|s need it, Kana-Kanji conversion server.  For Chinese inputting,
  it depends on the method of inputting, in some methods, PinYin or ZhuYin to
  HanZi conversion server is needed.  For Korean inputting, if you want to
  input Hanja, Hangul-Hanja conversion server is needed.

  For example, the Japanese inputting process is divided into 2 steps.  First
  we pre-input Hira-gana, second Kana-Kanji conversion.  There are so many
  Kanji characters (6349 Kanji characters are defined in JIS X 0208) and the
  number of Hira-gana characters are 76.  So, first, we pre-input text as
  pronounced in Hira-gana, second, we convert Hira-gana to Kanji or Kata-Kana,
  if needed.  There are some Kana-Kanji conversion server: jserver
  (distributed with Wnn, see below) and canna.  Canna can be found at:
  http://canna.sourceforge.jp/

There is a good input system: Wnn4.2.  Wnn 4.2 contains,
    xwnmo (|IM-server|)
    jserver (Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion server)
    cserver (Chinese PinYin or ZhuYin to simplified HanZi conversion server)
    tserver (Chinese PinYin or ZhuYin to traditional HanZi conversion server)
    kserver (Hangul-Hanja conversion server)
Wnn 4.2 for several systems can be found at various places on the internet.
Use the RPM or port for your system.


- Input Style
							*xim-input-style*
  When inputting CJK, there are four areas:
      1. The area to display of the input while it is being composed
      2. The area to display the currently active input mode.
      3. The area to display the next candidate for the selection.
      4. The area to display other tools.

  The third area is needed when converting.  For example, in Japanese
  inputting, multiple Kanji characters could have the same pronunciation, so
  a sequence of Hira-gana characters could map to a distinct sequence of Kanji
  characters.

  The first and second areas are defined in international input of X with the
  names of "Preedit Area", "Status Area" respectively.  The third and fourth
  areas are not defined and are left to be managed by the |IM-server|.  In the
  international input, four input styles have been defined using combinations
  of Preedit Area and Status Area: |OnTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot|, |OverTheSpot|
  and |Root|.

  Currently, GUI Vim supports three styles, |OverTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot| and
  |Root|.
  When compiled with |+GUI_GTK| feature, GUI Vim supports two styles,
  |OnTheSpot| and |OverTheSpot|.  You can select the style with the 'imstyle'
  option.

*.  on-the-spot						*OnTheSpot*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are performed by the client application in
    the area of application.  The client application is directed by the
    |IM-server| to display all pre-edit data at the location of text
    insertion.  The client registers callbacks invoked by the input method
    during pre-editing.
*.  over-the-spot					*OverTheSpot*
    Status Area is created in a fixed position within the area of application,
    in case of Vim, the position is the additional status line.  Preedit Area
    is made at present input position of application.  The input method
    displays pre-edit data in a window which it brings up directly over the
    text insertion position.
*.  off-the-spot					*OffTheSpot*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are performed in the area of application, in
    case of Vim, the area is additional status line.  The client application
    provides display windows for the pre-edit data to the input method which
    displays into them directly.
*.  root-window						*Root*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are outside of the application.  The input
    method displays all pre-edit data in a separate area of the screen in a
    window specific to the input method.


USING XIM			*multibyte-input* *E284* *E286* *E287* *E288*
				*E285* *E289*

Note that Display and Input are independent.  It is possible to see your
language even though you have no input method for it.  But when your Display
method doesn't match your Input method, the text will be displayed wrong.

	Note: You can not use IM unless you specify 'guifontset'.
	      Therefore, Latin users, you have to also use 'guifontset'
	      if you use IM.

To input your language you should run the |IM-server| which supports your
language and |conversion-server| if needed.

The next 3 lines should be put in your ~/.Xdefaults file.  They are common for
all X applications which uses |XIM|.  If you already use |XIM|, you can skip
this. >

	*international: True
	*.inputMethod: your_input_server_name
	*.preeditType: your_input_style
<
input_server_name	is your |IM-server| name (check your |IM-server|
			manual).
your_input_style	is one of |OverTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot|, |Root|.  See
			also |xim-input-style|.

*international may not necessary if you use X11R6.
*.inputMethod and *.preeditType are optional if you use X11R6.

For example, when you are using kinput2 as |IM-server|, >

	*international: True
	*.inputMethod: kinput2
	*.preeditType: OverTheSpot
<
When using |OverTheSpot|, GUI Vim always connects to the IM Server even in
Normal mode, so you can input your language with commands like "f" and "r".
But when using one of the other two methods, GUI Vim connects to the IM Server
only if it is not in Normal mode.

If your IM Server does not support |OverTheSpot|, and if you want to use your
language with some Normal mode command like "f" or "r", then you should use a
localized xterm  or an xterm which supports |XIM|

If needed, you can set the XMODIFIERS environment variable:

	sh:  export XMODIFIERS="@im=input_server_name"
	csh: setenv XMODIFIERS "@im=input_server_name"

For example, when you are using kinput2 as |IM-server| and sh, >

	export XMODIFIERS="@im=kinput2"
<

FULLY CONTROLLED XIM

You can fully control XIM, like with IME of MS-Windows (see |multibyte-ime|).
This is currently only available for the GTK GUI.

Before using fully controlled XIM, one setting is required.  Set the
'imactivatekey' option to the key that is used for the activation of the input
method.  For example, when you are using kinput2 + canna as IM Server, the
activation key is probably Shift+Space: >

	:set imactivatekey=S-space

See 'imactivatekey' for the format.

==============================================================================
8.  Input on MS-Windows					*mbyte-IME*

(Windows IME support)				*multibyte-ime* *IME*

{only works Windows GUI and compiled with the |+multi_byte_ime| feature}

To input multibyte characters on Windows, you can use an Input Method Editor
(IME).  In process of your editing text, you must switch status (on/off) of
IME many many many times.  Because IME with status on is hooking all of your
key inputs, you cannot input 'j', 'k', or almost all of keys to Vim directly.

This |+multi_byte_ime| feature help this.  It reduce times of switch status of
IME manually.  In normal mode, there are almost no need working IME, even
editing multibyte text.  So exiting insert mode with ESC, Vim memorize last
status of IME and force turn off IME.  When re-enter insert mode, Vim revert
IME status to that memorized automatically.

This works on not only insert-normal mode, but also search-command input and
replace mode.
The options 'iminsert', 'imsearch' and 'imcmdline' can be used to chose
the different input methods or disable them temporarily.

WHAT IS IME
    IME is a part of East asian version Windows.  That helps you to input
    multibyte character.  English and other language version Windows does not
    have any IME.  (Also there is no need usually.) But there is one that
    called Microsoft Global IME.  Global IME is a part of Internet Explorer
    4.0 or above.  You can get more information about Global IME, at below
    URL.

WHAT IS GLOBAL IME					*global-ime*
    Global IME makes capability to input Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text
    into Vim buffer on any language version of Windows 98, Windows 95, and
    Windows NT 4.0.
    On Windows 2000 and XP it should work as well (without downloading).  On
    Windows 2000 Professional, Global IME is built in, and the Input Locales
    can be added through Control Panel/Regional Options/Input Locales.
    Please see below URL for detail of Global IME.  You can also find various
    language version of Global IME at same place.

    - Global IME detailed information.
	http://search.microsoft.com/results.aspx?q=global+ime

    - Active Input Method Manager (Global IME)
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741221(v=VS.85).aspx

    Support for Global IME is an experimental feature.

NOTE: For IME to work you must make sure the input locales of your language
are added to your system.  The exact location of this depends on the version
of Windows you use.  For example, on my Windows 2000 box:
1. Control Panel
2. Regional Options
3. Input Locales Tab
4. Add Installed input locales -> Chinese(PRC)
   The default is still English (United Stated)


Cursor color when IME or XIM is on				*CursorIM*
    There is a little cute feature for IME.  Cursor can indicate status of IME
    by changing its color.  Usually status of IME was indicated by little icon
    at a corner of desktop (or taskbar).  It is not easy to verify status of
    IME.  But this feature help this.
    This works in the same way when using XIM.

    You can select cursor color when status is on by using highlight group
    CursorIM.  For example, add these lines to your |gvimrc|: >

	if has('multi_byte_ime')
	    highlight Cursor guifg=NONE guibg=Green
	    highlight CursorIM guifg=NONE guibg=Purple
	endif
<
    Cursor color with off IME is green.  And purple cursor indicates that
    status is on.

==============================================================================
9. Input with a keymap					*mbyte-keymap*

When the keyboard doesn't produce the characters you want to enter in your
text, you can use the 'keymap' option.  This will translate one or more
(English) characters to another (non-English) character.  This only happens
when typing text, not when typing Vim commands.  This avoids having to switch
between two keyboard settings.
{only available when compiled with the |+keymap| feature}

The value of the 'keymap' option specifies a keymap file to use.  The name of
this file is one of these two:

	keymap/{keymap}_{encoding}.vim
	keymap/{keymap}.vim

Here {keymap} is the value of the 'keymap' option and {encoding} of the
'encoding' option.  The file name with the {encoding} included is tried first.

'runtimepath' is used to find these files.  To see an overview of all
available keymap files, use this: >
	:echo globpath(&rtp, "keymap/*.vim")

In Insert and Command-line mode you can use CTRL-^ to toggle between using the
keyboard map or not. |i_CTRL-^| |c_CTRL-^|
This flag is remembered for Insert mode with the 'iminsert' option.  When
leaving and entering Insert mode the previous value is used.  The same value
is also used for commands that take a single character argument, like |f| and
|r|.
For Command-line mode the flag is NOT remembered.  You are expected to type an
Ex command first, which is ASCII.
For typing search patterns the 'imsearch' option is used.  It can be set to
use the same value as for 'iminsert'.
								*lCursor*
It is possible to give the GUI cursor another color when the language mappings
are being used.  This is disabled by default, to avoid that the cursor becomes
invisible when you use a non-standard background color.  Here is an example to
use a brightly colored cursor: >
	:highlight Cursor guifg=NONE guibg=Green
	:highlight lCursor guifg=NONE guibg=Cyan
<
		*keymap-file-format* *:loadk* *:loadkeymap* *E105* *E791*
The keymap file looks something like this: >

	" Maintainer:	name <email@address>
	" Last Changed:	2001 Jan 1

	let b:keymap_name = "short"

	loadkeymap
	a	A
	b	B	comment

The lines starting with a " are comments and will be ignored.  Blank lines are
also ignored.  The lines with the mappings may have a comment after the useful
text.

The "b:keymap_name" can be set to a short name, which will be shown in the
status line.  The idea is that this takes less room than the value of
'keymap', which might be long to distinguish between different languages,
keyboards and encodings.

The actual mappings are in the lines below "loadkeymap".  In the example "a"
is mapped to "A" and "b" to "B".  Thus the first item is mapped to the second
item.  This is done for each line, until the end of the file.
These items are exactly the same as what can be used in a |:lnoremap| command,
using "<buffer>" to make the mappings local to the buffer.
You can check the result with this command: >
	:lmap
The two items must be separated by white space.  You cannot include white
space inside an item, use the special names "<Tab>" and "<Space>" instead.
The length of the two items together must not exceed 200 bytes.

It's possible to have more than one character in the first column.  This works
like a dead key.  Example: >
	'a	
Since Vim doesn't know if the next character after a quote is really an "a",
it will wait for the next character.  To be able to insert a single quote,
also add this line: >
	''	'
Since the mapping is defined with |:lnoremap| the resulting quote will not be
used for the start of another character.
The "accents" keymap uses this.				*keymap-accents*

The first column can also be in |<>| form:
	<C-c>		Ctrl-C
	<A-c>		Alt-c
	<A-C>		Alt-C
Note that the Alt mappings may not work, depending on your keyboard and
terminal.

Although it's possible to have more than one character in the second column,
this is unusual.  But you can use various ways to specify the character: >
	A	a		literal character
	A	<char-97>	decimal value
	A	<char-0x61>	hexadecimal value
	A	<char-0141>	octal value
	x	<Space>		special key name

The characters are assumed to be encoded for the current value of 'encoding'.
It's possible to use ":scriptencoding" when all characters are given
literally.  That doesn't work when using the <char-> construct, because the
conversion is done on the keymap file, not on the resulting character.

The lines after "loadkeymap" are interpreted with 'cpoptions' set to "C".
This means that continuation lines are not used and a backslash has a special
meaning in the mappings.  Examples: >

	" a comment line
	\"	x	maps " to x
	\\	y	maps \ to y

If you write a keymap file that will be useful for others, consider submitting
it to the Vim maintainer for inclusion in the distribution:
<maintainer@vim.org>

10. Using UTF-8				*mbyte-utf8* *UTF-8* *utf-8* *utf8*
							*Unicode* *unicode*
The Unicode character set was designed to include all characters from other
character sets.  Therefore it is possible to write text in any language using
Unicode (with a few rarely used languages excluded).  And it's mostly possible
to mix these languages in one file, which is impossible with other encodings.

Unicode can be encoded in several ways.  The most popular one is UTF-8, which
uses one or more bytes for each character and is backwards compatible with
ASCII.   On MS-Windows UTF-16 is also used (previously UCS-2), which uses
16-bit words.  Vim can support all of these encodings, but always uses UTF-8
internally.

Vim has comprehensive UTF-8 support.  It works well in:
- xterm with utf-8 support enabled
- Athena, Motif and GTK GUI
- MS-Windows GUI
- several other platforms

Double-width characters are supported.  This works best with 'guifontwide' or
'guifontset'.  When using only 'guifont' the wide characters are drawn in the
normal width and a space to fill the gap.  Note that the 'guifontset' option
is no longer relevant in the GTK+ 2 GUI.

							*bom-bytes*
When reading a file a BOM (Byte Order Mark) can be used to recognize the
Unicode encoding:
	EF BB BF     utf-8
	FE FF        utf-16 big endian
	FF FE        utf-16 little endian
	00 00 FE FF  utf-32 big endian
	FF FE 00 00  utf-32 little endian

Utf-8 is the recommended encoding.  Note that it's difficult to tell utf-16
and utf-32 apart.  Utf-16 is often used on MS-Windows, utf-32 is not
widespread as file format.


					*mbyte-combining* *mbyte-composing*
A composing or combining character is used to change the meaning of the
character before it.  The combining characters are drawn on top of the
preceding character.
Up to two combining characters can be used by default.  This can be changed
with the 'maxcombine' option.
When editing text a composing character is mostly considered part of the
preceding character.  For example "x" will delete a character and its
following composing characters by default.
If the 'delcombine' option is on, then pressing 'x' will delete the combining
characters, one at a time, then the base character.  But when inserting, you
type the first character and the following composing characters separately,
after which they will be joined.  The "r" command will not allow you to type a
combining character, because it doesn't know one is coming.  Use "R" instead.

Bytes which are not part of a valid UTF-8 byte sequence are handled like a
single character and displayed as <xx>, where "xx" is the hex value of the
byte.

Overlong sequences are not handled specially and displayed like a valid
character.  However, search patterns may not match on an overlong sequence.
(an overlong sequence is where more bytes are used than required for the
character.)  An exception is NUL (zero) which is displayed as "<00>".

In the file and buffer the full range of Unicode characters can be used (31
bits).  However, displaying only works for the characters present in the
selected font.

Useful commands:
- "ga" shows the decimal, hexadecimal and octal value of the character under
  the cursor.  If there are composing characters these are shown too.  (If the
  message is truncated, use ":messages").
- "g8" shows the bytes used in a UTF-8 character, also the composing
  characters, as hex numbers.
- ":set encoding=utf-8 fileencodings=" forces using UTF-8 for all files.  The
  default is to use the current locale for 'encoding' and set 'fileencodings'
  to automatically detect the encoding of a file.


STARTING VIM

If your current locale is in an utf-8 encoding, Vim will automatically start
in utf-8 mode.

If you are using another locale: >

	set encoding=utf-8

You might also want to select the font used for the menus.  Unfortunately this
doesn't always work.  See the system specific remarks below, and 'langmenu'.


USING UTF-8 IN X-Windows				*utf-8-in-xwindows*

Note: This section does not apply to the GTK+ 2 GUI.

You need to specify a font to be used.  For double-wide characters another
font is required, which is exactly twice as wide.  There are three ways to do
this:

1. Set 'guifont' and let Vim find a matching 'guifontwide'
2. Set 'guifont' and 'guifontwide'
3. Set 'guifontset'

See the documentation for each option for details.  Example: >

   :set guifont=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1

You might also want to set the font used for the menus.  This only works for
Motif.  Use the ":hi Menu font={fontname}" command for this. |:highlight|


TYPING UTF-8						*utf-8-typing*

If you are using X-Windows, you should find an input method that supports
utf-8.

If your system does not provide support for typing utf-8, you can use the
'keymap' feature.  This allows writing a keymap file, which defines a utf-8
character as a sequence of ASCII characters.  See |mbyte-keymap|.

Another method is to set the current locale to the language you want to use
and for which you have a XIM available.  Then set 'termencoding' to that
language and Vim will convert the typed characters to 'encoding' for you.

If everything else fails, you can type any character as four hex bytes: >

	CTRL-V u 1234

"1234" is interpreted as a hex number.  You must type four characters, prepend
a zero if necessary.


COMMAND ARGUMENTS					*utf-8-char-arg*

Commands like |f|, |F|, |t| and |r| take an argument of one character.  For
UTF-8 this argument may include one or two composing characters.  These need
to be produced together with the base character, Vim doesn't wait for the next
character to be typed to find out if it is a composing character or not.
Using 'keymap' or |:lmap| is a nice way to type these characters.

The commands that search for a character in a line handle composing characters
as follows.  When searching for a character without a composing character,
this will find matches in the text with or without composing characters.  When
searching for a character with a composing character, this will only find
matches with that composing character.  It was implemented this way, because
not everybody is able to type a composing character.


==============================================================================
11. Overview of options					*mbyte-options*

These options are relevant for editing multi-byte files.  Check the help in
options.txt for detailed information.

'encoding'	Encoding used for the keyboard and display.  It is also the
		default encoding for files.

'fileencoding'	Encoding of a file.  When it's different from 'encoding'
		conversion is done when reading or writing the file.

'fileencodings'	List of possible encodings of a file.  When opening a file
		these will be tried and the first one that doesn't cause an
		error is used for 'fileencoding'.

'charconvert'	Expression used to convert files from one encoding to another.

'formatoptions' The 'm' flag can be included to have formatting break a line
		at a multibyte character of 256 or higher.  Thus is useful for
		languages where a sequence of characters can be broken
		anywhere.

'guifontset'	The list of font names used for a multi-byte encoding.  When
		this option is not empty, it replaces 'guifont'.

'keymap'	Specify the name of a keyboard mapping.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Multi-language features				*multilang* *multi-lang*

This is about using messages and menus in various languages.  For editing
multi-byte text see |multibyte|.

The basics are explained in the user manual: |usr_45.txt|.

1. Messages			|multilang-messages|
2. Menus			|multilang-menus|
3. Scripts			|multilang-scripts|

Also see |help-translated| for multi-language help.

{Vi does not have any of these features}
{not available when compiled without the |+multi_lang| feature}

==============================================================================
1. Messages						*multilang-messages*

Vim picks up the locale from the environment.  In most cases this means Vim
will use the language that you prefer, unless it's not available.

To see a list of supported locale names on your system, look in one of these
directories (for Unix):
	/usr/lib/locale ~
	/usr/share/locale ~
Unfortunately, upper/lowercase differences matter.  Also watch out for the
use of "-" and "_".

					    *:lan* *:lang* *:language* *E197*
:lan[guage]
:lan[guage] mes[sages]
:lan[guage] cty[pe]
:lan[guage] tim[e]
			Print the current language (aka locale).
			With the "messages" argument the language used for
			messages is printed.  Technical: LC_MESSAGES.
			With the "ctype" argument the language used for
			character encoding is printed.  Technical: LC_CTYPE.
			With the "time" argument the language used for
			strftime() is printed.  Technical: LC_TIME.
			Without argument all parts of the locale are printed
			(this is system dependent).
			The current language can also be obtained with the
			|v:lang|, |v:ctype| and |v:lc_time| variables.

:lan[guage] {name}
:lan[guage] mes[sages] {name}
:lan[guage] cty[pe] {name}
:lan[guage] tim[e] {name}
			Set the current language (aka locale) to {name}.
			The locale {name} must be a valid locale on your
			system.  Some systems accept aliases like "en" or
			"en_US", but some only accept the full specification
			like "en_US.ISO_8859-1".  On Unix systems you can use
			this command to see what locales are supported: >
				:!locale -a
<			With the "messages" argument the language used for
			messages is set.  This can be different when you want,
			for example, English messages while editing Japanese
			text.  This sets $LC_MESSAGES.
			With the "ctype" argument the language used for
			character encoding is set.  This affects the libraries
			that Vim was linked with.  It's unusual to set this to
			a different value from 'encoding' or "C".  This sets
			$LC_CTYPE.
			With the "time" argument the language used for time
			and date messages is set.  This affects strftime().
			This sets $LC_TIME.
			Without an argument both are set, and additionally
			$LANG is set.
			When compiled with the |+float| feature the LC_NUMERIC
			value will always be set to "C", so that floating
			point numbers use '.' as the decimal point.
			This will make a difference for items that depend on
			the language (some messages, time and date format).
			Not fully supported on all systems
			If this fails there will be an error message.  If it
			succeeds there is no message.  Example: >
				:language
				Current language: C
				:language de_DE.ISO_8859-1
				:language mes
				Current messages language: de_DE.ISO_8859-1
				:lang mes en
<

MS-WINDOWS MESSAGE TRANSLATIONS				*win32-gettext*

If you used the self-installing .exe file, message translations should work
already.  Otherwise get the libintl.dll file if you don't have it yet:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gettext
Or:
	https://mlocati.github.io/gettext-iconv-windows/

This also contains tools xgettext, msgformat and others.

libintl.dll should be placed in same directory with (g)vim.exe, or some
place where PATH environment value describe.  Vim also finds libintl-8.dll.
Message files (vim.mo) have to be placed in "$VIMRUNTIME/lang/xx/LC_MESSAGES",
where "xx" is the abbreviation of the language (mostly two letters).

If you write your own translations you need to generate the .po file and
convert it to a .mo file.  You need to get the source distribution and read
the file "src/po/README.txt".

To overrule the automatic choice of the language, set the $LANG variable to
the language of your choice.  use "en" to disable translations. >

  :let $LANG = 'ja'

(text for Windows by Muraoka Taro)

==============================================================================
2. Menus						*multilang-menus*

See |45.2| for the basics, esp. using 'langmenu'.

Note that if changes have been made to the menus after the translation was
done, some of the menus may be shown in English.  Please try contacting the
maintainer of the translation and ask him to update it.  You can find the
name and e-mail address of the translator in
"$VIMRUNTIME/lang/menu_<lang>.vim".

To set the font (or fontset) to use for the menus, use the |:highlight|
command.  Example: >

	:highlight Menu font=k12,r12


ALIAS LOCALE NAMES

Unfortunately, the locale names are different on various systems, even though
they are for the same language and encoding.  If you do not get the menu
translations you expected, check the output of this command: >

	echo v:lang

Now check the "$VIMRUNTIME/lang" directory for menu translation files that use
a similar language.  A difference in a "-" being a "_" already causes a file
not to be found!  Another common difference to watch out for is "iso8859-1"
versus "iso_8859-1".  Fortunately Vim makes all names lowercase, thus you
don't have to worry about case differences.  Spaces are changed to
underscores, to avoid having to escape them.

If you find a menu translation file for your language with a different name,
create a file in your own runtime directory to load that one.  The name of
that file could be: >

	~/.vim/lang/menu_<v:lang>.vim

Check the 'runtimepath' option for directories which are searched.  In that
file put a command to load the menu file with the other name: >

	runtime lang/menu_<other_lang>.vim


TRANSLATING MENUS

If you want to do your own translations, you can use the |:menutrans| command,
explained below.  It is recommended to put the translations for one language
in a Vim script.  For a language that has no translation yet, please consider
becoming the maintainer and make your translations available to all Vim users.
Send an e-mail to the Vim maintainer <maintainer@vim.org>.

					*:menut* *:menutrans* *:menutranslate*
:menut[ranslate] clear
			Clear all menu translations.

:menut[ranslate] {english} {mylang}
			Translate menu name {english} to {mylang}.  All
			special characters like "&" and "<Tab>" need to be
			included.  Spaces and dots need to be escaped with a
			backslash, just like in other |:menu| commands.
			Case in {english} is ignored.

See the $VIMRUNTIME/lang directory for examples.

To try out your translations you first have to remove all menus.  This is how
you can do it without restarting Vim: >
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
	:source <your-new-menu-file>
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim

Each part of a menu path is translated separately.  The result is that when
"Help" is translated to "Hilfe" and "Overview" to "berblick" then
"Help.Overview" will be translated to "Hilfe.berblick".

==============================================================================
3. Scripts						*multilang-scripts*

In Vim scripts you can use the |v:lang| variable to get the current language
(locale).  The default value is "C" or comes from the $LANG environment
variable.

The following example shows how this variable is used in a simple way, to make
a message adapt to language preferences of the user, >

	:if v:lang =~ "de_DE"
	:  echo "Guten Morgen"
	:else
	:  echo "Good morning"
	:endif

Arabic Language support (options & mappings) for Vim		*Arabic*

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

								*E800*
In order to use right-to-left and Arabic mapping support, it is
necessary to compile Vim with the |+arabic| feature.

These functions have been created by Nadim Shaikli <nadim-at-arabeyes.org>

It is best to view this file with these settings within Vim's GUI: >

	:set encoding=utf-8
	:set arabicshape


Introduction
------------
Arabic is a rather demanding language in which a number of special
features are required.	Characters are right-to-left oriented and
ought to appear as such on the screen (i.e. from right to left).
Arabic also requires shaping of its characters, meaning the same
character has a different visual form based on its relative location
within a word (initial, medial, final or stand-alone).	Arabic also
requires two different forms of combining and the ability, in
certain instances, to either superimpose up to two characters on top
of another (composing) or the actual substitution of two characters
into one (combining).  Lastly, to display Arabic properly one will
require not only ISO-8859-6 (U+0600-U+06FF) fonts, but will also
require Presentation Form-B (U+FE70-U+FEFF) fonts both of which are
subsets within a so-called ISO-10646-1 font.

The commands, prompts and help files are not in Arabic, therefore
the user interface remains the standard Vi interface.


Highlights
----------
o  Editing left-to-right files as in the original Vim hasn't changed.

o  Viewing and editing files in right-to-left windows.	 File
   orientation is per window, so it is possible to view the same
   file in right-to-left and left-to-right modes, simultaneously.

o  No special terminal with right-to-left capabilities is required.
   The right-to-left changes are completely hardware independent.
   Only Arabic fonts are necessary.

o  Compatible with the original Vim.   Almost all features work in
   right-to-left mode (there are liable to be bugs).

o  Changing keyboard mapping and reverse insert modes using a single
   command.

o  Toggling complete Arabic support via a single command.

o  While in Arabic mode, numbers are entered from left to right.  Upon
   entering a none number character, that character will be inserted
   just into the left of the last number.

o  Arabic keymapping on the command line in reverse insert mode.

o  Proper Bidirectional functionality is possible given Vim is
   started within a Bidi capable terminal emulator.


Arabic Fonts						*arabicfonts*
------------

Vim requires monospaced fonts of which there are many out there.
Arabic requires ISO-8859-6 as well as Presentation Form-B fonts
(without Form-B, Arabic will _NOT_ be usable).	It is highly
recommended that users search for so-called 'ISO-10646-1' fonts.
Do an Internet search or check www.arabeyes.org for further
info on where to attain the necessary Arabic fonts.


Font Installation
-----------------

o  Installation of fonts for X Window systems (Unix/Linux)

   Depending on your system, copy your_ARABIC_FONT file into a
   directory of your choice.  Change to the directory containing
   the Arabic fonts and execute the following commands:

     %	mkfontdir
     %	xset +fp path_name_of_arabic_fonts_directory


Usage
-----
Prior to the actual usage of Arabic within Vim, a number of settings
need to be accounted for and invoked.

o  Setting the Arabic fonts

   +  For Vim GUI set the 'guifont' to your_ARABIC_FONT.  This is done
      by entering the following command in the Vim window.
>
		:set guifont=your_ARABIC_FONT
<
      NOTE: the string 'your_ARABIC_FONT' is used to denote a complete
	    font name akin to that used in Linux/Unix systems.
	    (e.g. -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--20-200-75-75-c-100-iso10646-1)

      You can append the 'guifont' set command to your .vimrc file
      in order to get the same above noted results.  In other words,
      you can include ':set guifont=your_ARABIC_FONT' to your .vimrc
      file.

   +  Under the X Window environment, you can also start Vim with
      '-fn your_ARABIC_FONT' option.

o  Setting the appropriate character Encoding
   To enable the correct Arabic encoding the following command needs
   to be appended,
>
		:set encoding=utf-8
<
   to your .vimrc file (entering the command manually into you Vim
   window is highly discouraged).  In short, include ':set
   encoding=utf-8' to your .vimrc file.

   Attempts to use Arabic without UTF-8 will result the following
   warning message,

								*W17*  >
     Arabic requires UTF-8, do ':set encoding=utf-8'

o  Enable Arabic settings [short-cut]

   In order to simplify and streamline things, you can either invoke
   Vim with the command-line option,

     % vim -A my_utf8_arabic_file ...

   or enable 'arabic' via the following command within Vim
>
		:set arabic
<
   The two above noted possible invocations are the preferred manner
   in which users are instructed to proceed.  Barring an enabled 'termbidi'
   setting, both command options:

     1. set the appropriate keymap
     2. enable the deletion of a single combined pair character
     3. enable rightleft    mode
     4. enable rightleftcmd mode (affecting the command-line)
     5. enable arabicshape  mode (do visual character alterations)

   You may also append the command to your .vimrc file and simply
   include ':set arabic' to it.

   You are also capable of disabling Arabic support via
>
		:set noarabic
<
   which resets everything that the command had enabled without touching
   the global settings as they could affect other possible open buffers.
   In short the 'noarabic' command,

     1. resets to the alternate keymap
     2. disables the deletion of a single combined pair character
     3. disables rightleft mode

   NOTE: the 'arabic' command takes into consideration 'termbidi' for
	 possible external bi-directional (bidi) support from the
	 terminal ("mlterm" for instance offers such support).
	 'termbidi', if available, is superior to rightleft support
	 and its support is preferred due to its level of offerings.
	 'arabic' when 'termbidi' is enabled only sets the keymap.

   If, on the other hand, you'd like to be verbose and explicit and
   are opting not to use the 'arabic' short-cut command, here's what
   is needed (i.e. if you use ':set arabic' you can skip this section) -

   +  Arabic Keymapping Activation

      To activate the Arabic keymap (i.e. to remap your English/Latin
      keyboard to look-n-feel like a standard Arabic one), set the
      'keymap' command to "arabic".  This is done by entering
>
		:set keymap=arabic
<
      in your Vim window.  You can also append the 'keymap' set command to
      your .vimrc file.  In other words, you can include ':set keymap=arabic'
      to your .vimrc file.

      To turn toggle (or switch) your keymapping between Arabic and the
      default mapping (English), it is advised that users use the 'CTRL-^'
      key press while in insert (or add/replace) mode.	The command-line
      will display your current mapping by displaying an "Arabic" string
      next to your insertion mode (e.g. -- INSERT Arabic --) indicating
      your current keymap.

   +  Arabic deletion of a combined pair character

      By default Vim has the 'delcombine' option disabled.  This option
      allows the deletion of ALEF in a LAM_ALEF (LAA) combined character
      and still retain the LAM (i.e. it reverts to treating the combined
      character as its natural two characters form -- this also pertains
      to harakat and their combined forms).  You can enable this option
      by entering
>
		:set delcombine
<
      in our Vim window.  You can also append the 'delcombine' set command
      to your .vimrc file.  In other words, you can include ':set delcombine'
      to your .vimrc file.

   +  Arabic right-to-left Mode

      By default Vim starts in Left-to-right mode.  'rightleft' is the
      command that allows one to alter a window's orientation - that can
      be accomplished via,

      - Toggling between left-to-right and right-to-left modes is
	accomplished through ':set rightleft' and ':set norightleft'.

      - While in Left-to-right mode, enter ':set rl' in the command line
	('rl' is the abbreviation for rightleft).

      - Put the ':set rl' line in your '.vimrc' file to start Vim in
	right-to-left mode permanently.

   +  Arabic right-to-left command-line Mode

      For certain commands the editing can be done in right-to-left mode.
      Currently this is only applicable to search commands.

      This is controlled with the 'rightleftcmd' option.  The default is
      "search", which means that windows in which 'rightleft' is set will
      edit search commands in right-left mode.	To disable this behavior,
>
		:set rightleftcmd=
<
      To enable right-left editing of search commands again,
>
		:set rightleftcmd&
<
   +  Arabic Shaping Mode

      To activate the required visual characters alterations (shaping,
      composing, combining) which the Arabic language requires, enable
      the 'arabicshape' command.  This is done by entering
>
		:set arabicshape
<
      in our Vim window.  You can also append the 'arabicshape' set
      command to your .vimrc file.  In other words, you can include
      ':set arabicshape' to your .vimrc file.


Keymap/Keyboard						*arabickeymap*
---------------

The character/letter encoding used in Vim is the standard UTF-8.
It is widely discouraged that any other encoding be used or even
attempted.

Note: UTF-8 is an all encompassing encoding and as such is
      the only supported (and encouraged) encoding with
      regard to Arabic (all other proprietary encodings
      should be discouraged and frowned upon).

o  Keyboard

   +  CTRL-^ in insert/replace mode toggles between Arabic/Latin mode

   +  Keyboard mapping is based on the Microsoft's Arabic keymap (the
      de facto standard in the Arab world):

  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |!   |@   |#   |$   |%   |^   |&   |*   |(   |)   |_   |+   ||   |~   |
  |1  |2  |3  |4  |5  |6  |7  |8  |9  |0  |-   |=   |\   |`  |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
       |Q   |W   |E   |R   |T  |Y  |U ` |I  |O x |P  |{ < |} > |
       |q  |w  |e  |r  |t  |y  |u  |i  |o  |p  |[  |]  |
       +-----------------------------------------------------------+
	 |A   |S   |D [ |F ] |G  |H  |J  |K  |L / |:   |"   |
	 |a  |s  |d  |f  |g  |h  |j  |k  |l  |;  |'  |
	 +------------------------------------------------------+
	   |Z ~ |X   |C { |V } |B  |N  |M ' |< , |> . |?  |
	   |z  |x  |c  |v  |b  |n  |m  |,  |.  |/  |
	   +-------------------------------------------------+

Restrictions
------------

o  Vim in its GUI form does not currently support Bi-directionality
   (i.e. the ability to see both Arabic and Latin intermixed within
   the same line).


Known Bugs
----------

There is one known minor bug,

 1. If you insert a haraka (e.g. Fatha (U+064E)) after a LAM (U+0644)
    and then insert an ALEF (U+0627), the appropriate combining will
    not happen due to the sandwiched haraka resulting in something
    that will NOT be displayed correctly.

    WORK-AROUND: Don't include harakats between LAM and ALEF combos.
		 In general, don't anticipate to see correct visual
		 representation with regard to harakats and LAM+ALEF
		 combined characters (even those entered after both
		 characters).  The problem noted is strictly a visual
		 one, meaning saving such a file will contain all the
		 appropriate info/encodings - nothing is lost.

No other bugs are known to exist.

Right to Left and Farsi Mapping for Vim		*farsi* *Farsi*

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

						*E27*
In order to use right-to-left and Farsi mapping support, it is necessary to
compile Vim with the |+farsi| feature.

These functions have been made by Mortaza G. Shiran <shiran@jps.net>


Introduction
------------
In right-to-left oriented files the characters appear on the screen from right
to left.  This kind of file is most useful when writing Farsi documents,
composing faxes or writing Farsi memos.

The commands, prompts and help files are not in Farsi, therefore the user
interface remains the standard Vi interface.


Highlights
----------
o  Editing left-to-right files as in the original Vim, no change.

o  Viewing and editing files in right-to-left windows.   File orientation is
   per window, so it is possible to view the same file in right-to-left and
   left-to-right modes, simultaneously.

o  Compatibility to the original Vim.   Almost all features work in
   right-to-left mode (see bugs below).

o  Changing keyboard mapping and reverse insert modes using a single
   command.

o  Backing from reverse insert mode to the correct place in the file
   (if possible).

o  While in Farsi mode, numbers are entered from left to right.  Upon entering
   a none number character, that character will be inserted just into the
   left of the last number.

o  No special terminal with right-to-left capabilities is required.  The
   right-to-left changes are completely hardware independent.  Only
   Farsi font is necessary.

o  Farsi keymapping on the command line in reverse insert mode.

o  Toggling between left-to-right and right-to-left via F8 function key.

o  Toggling between Farsi ISIR-3342 standard encoding and Vim Farsi via F9
   function key.  Since this makes sense only for the text written in
   right-to-left mode, this function is also supported only in right-to-left
   mode.

Farsi Fonts					*farsi-fonts*
-----------

The following files are found in the subdirectories of the '$VIM/farsi/fonts'
directory:

   +  far-a01.pcf    X Windows fonts for Unix including Linux systems
   +  far-a01.bf     X Windows fonts for SunOS
   +  far-a01.f16    a screen fonts for Unix including Linux systems
   +  far-a01.fon    a monospaced fonts for Windows NT/95/98
   +  far-a01.com    a screen fonts for DOS


Font Installation
-----------------

o  Installation of fonts for MS Window systems (NT/95/98)

   From 'Control Panel' folder, start the 'Fonts' program.  Then from 'file'
   menu item select 'Install New Fonts ...'.  Browse and select the
   'far-a01.fon', then follow the installation guide.
   NOTE: several people have reported that this does not work.  The solution
   is unknown.

o  Installation of fonts for X Window systems (Unix/Linux)

   Depending on your system, copy far-a01.pcf.Z or far-a01.pcf.gz into a
   directory of your choice.  Change to the directory containing the Farsi
   fonts and execute the following commands:

   >  mkfontdir
   >  xset +fp path_name_of_farsi_fonts_directory

o  Installation of fonts for X Window systems (SunOS)

   Copy far-a01.bf font into a directory of your choice.
   Change to the directory containing the far-a01.fb fonts and
   execute the following commands:

   >  fldfamily
   >  xset +fp path_name_of_fonts_directory

o  Installation of ASCII screen fonts (Unix/Linux)

   For Linux system, copy the far-a01.f16 fonts into /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts
   directory and execute the setfont program as "setfont far-a01.f16".  For
   other systems (e.g. SCO Unix), please refer to the fonts installation
   section of your system administration manuals.

o  Installation of ASCII screen fonts (DOS)

   After system power on, prior to the first use of Vim, upload the Farsi
   fonts by executing the far-a01.com font uploading program.


Usage
-----
Prior to starting Vim, the environment in which Vim can run in Farsi mode,
must be set.  In addition to installation of Farsi fonts, following points
refer to some of the system environments, which you may need to set:
Key code mapping, loading graphic card in ASCII screen mode, setting the IO
driver in 8 bit clean mode ... .

o  Setting the Farsi fonts

   +  For Vim GUI set the 'guifont' to far-a01.  This is done by entering
      ':set guifont=far-a01' in the Vim window.

      You can have 'guifont' set to far-a01 by Vim during the Vim startup
      by appending the ':set guifont=far-a01' into your .vimrc file
      (in case of NT/95/98 platforms _vimrc).

      Under the X Window environment, you can also start Vim with the
      '-fn far-a01' option.

   +  For Vim within a xterm, start a xterm with the Farsi fonts (e.g.
      kterm -fn far-a01).  Then start Vim inside the kterm.

   +  For Vim under DOS, prior to the first usage of Vim, upload the Farsi
      fonts by executing the far-a01.com fonts uploading program.

o  Farsi Keymapping Activation

   To activate the Farsi keymapping, set either 'altkeymap' or 'fkmap'.
   This is done by entering ':set akm' or ':set fk' in the Vim window.
   You can have 'altkeymap' or 'fkmap' set as default by appending ':set akm'
   or ':set fk' in your .vimrc file or _vimrc in case of NT/95/98 platforms.

   To turn off the Farsi keymapping as a default second language keymapping,
   reset the 'altkeymap' by entering ':set noakm'.

o  right-to-left Farsi Mode

   By default Vim starts in Left-to-right mode.  Following are ways to change
   the window orientation:

   + Start Vim with the -F option (e.g. vim -F ...).

   + Use the F8 function key to toggle between left-to-right and right-to-left.

   + While in Left-to-right mode, enter 'set rl' in the command line ('rl' is
     the abbreviation for rightleft).

   + Put the 'set rl' line in your '.vimrc' file to start Vim in
     right-to-left mode permanently.

Encoding
--------

The letter encoding used is the Vim extended ISIR-3342 standard with a built
in function to convert between Vim extended ISIR-3342 and ISIR-3342 standard.

For document portability reasons, the letter encoding is kept the same across
different platforms (i.e. UNIX's, NT/95/98, MS DOS, ...).


o  Keyboard

   +  CTRL-_ in insert/replace modes toggles between Farsi(akm)/Latin
      mode as follows:

   +  CTRL-_ moves the cursor to the end of the typed text in edit mode.

   +  CTRL-_ in command mode only toggles keyboard mapping between Farsi(akm)/
      Latin.  The Farsi text is then entered in reverse insert mode.

   +  F8 - Toggles between left-to-right and right-to-left.

   +  F9 - Toggles the encoding between ISIR-3342 standard and Vim extended
      ISIR-3342 (supported only in right-to-left mode).

   +  Keyboard mapping is based on the Iranian ISIRI-2901 standard.
      Following table shows the keyboard mapping while Farsi(akm) mode set:

	-------------------------------------
	`  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  -  =
	                        
	-------------------------------------
	~  !  @  #  $  %  ^  &  *  (  )  _  +
	~                        
	-------------------------------------
	q  w  e  r  t  z  u  i  o  p  [  ]
	                      
	-------------------------------------
	Q  W  E  R  T  Z  U  I  O  P  {  }
	                [  ]  {  }
	-------------------------------------
	a  s  d  f  g  h  j  k  l  ;  '  \
	                      
	-------------------------------------
	A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K  L  :  "  |
	                     
	-------------------------------------
	<  y  x  c  v  b  n  m  ,  .  /
	                    
	-------------------------------------
	>  Y  X  C  V  B  N  M  <  >  ?
	                    
	-------------------------------------

Note:
	  stands for Farsi PSP (break without space)

	  stands for Farsi PCN (for HAMZE attribute)

Restrictions
------------

o  In insert/replace mode and fkmap (Farsi mode) set, CTRL-B is not
   supported.

o  If you change the character mapping between Latin/Farsi, the redo buffer
   will be reset (emptied).  That is, redo is valid and will function (using
   '.') only within the mode you are in.

o  While numbers are entered in Farsi mode, the redo buffer will be reset
   (emptied).  That is, you cannot redo the last changes (using '.') after
   entering numbers.

o  While in left-to-right mode and Farsi mode set, CTRL-R is not supported.

o  While in right-to-left mode, the search on 'Latin' pattern does not work,
   except if you enter the Latin search pattern in reverse.

o  In command mode there is no support for entering numbers from left
   to right and also for the sake of flexibility the keymapping logic is
   restricted.

o  Under the X Window environment, if you want to run Vim within a xterm
   terminal emulator and Farsi mode set, you need to have an ANSI compatible
   xterm terminal emulator.  This is because the letter codes above 128 decimal
   have certain meanings in the standard xterm terminal emulator.

   Note: Under X Window environment, Vim GUI works fine in Farsi mode.
	 This eliminates the need of any xterm terminal emulator.


Bugs
----
While in insert/replace and Farsi mode set, if you repeatedly change the
cursor position (via cursor movement) and enter new text and then try to undo
the last change, the undo will lag one change behind.  But as you continue to
undo, you will reach the original line of text.  You can also use U to undo all
changes made in the current line.

Hebrew Language support (options & mapping) for Vim		*hebrew*

The supporting 'rightleft' functionality was originally created by Avner
Lottem. <alottem at gmail dot com>  Ron Aaron <ron at ronware dot org> is
currently helping support these features.

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

All this is only available when the |+rightleft| feature was enabled at
compile time.


Introduction
------------
Hebrew-specific options are 'hkmap', 'hkmapp' 'keymap'=hebrew and 'aleph'.
Hebrew-useful options are 'delcombine', 'allowrevins', 'revins', 'rightleft'
and 'rightleftcmd'.

The 'rightleft' mode reverses the display order, so characters are displayed
from right to left instead of the usual left to right.  This is useful
primarily when editing Hebrew or other Middle-Eastern languages.
See |rileft.txt| for further details.

Details
--------------
+  Options:
   +  'rightleft' ('rl') sets window orientation to right-to-left.  This means
      that the logical text 'ABC' will be displayed as 'CBA', and will start
      drawing at the right edge of the window, not the left edge.
   +  'hkmap' ('hk') sets keyboard mapping to Hebrew, in insert/replace modes.
   +  'aleph' ('al'), numeric, holds the decimal code of Aleph, for keyboard
      mapping.
   +  'hkmapp' ('hkp') sets keyboard mapping to 'phonetic hebrew'

   NOTE: these three ('hkmap', 'hkmapp' and 'aleph') are obsolete.  You should
	 use ":set keymap=hebrewp" instead.

   +  'delcombine' ('deco'), boolean, if editing UTF-8 encoded Hebrew, allows
      one to remove the niqud or te`amim by pressing 'x' on a character (with
      associated niqud).

   +  'rightleftcmd' ('rlc') makes the command-prompt for searches show up on
      the right side.  It only takes effect if the window is 'rightleft'.

+  Encoding:
   +  Under Unix, ISO 8859-8 encoding (Hebrew letters codes: 224-250).
   +  Under MS DOS, PC encoding (Hebrew letters codes: 128-154).
      These are defaults, that can be overridden using the 'aleph' option.
   +  You should prefer using UTF8, as it supports the combining-characters
      ('deco' does nothing if UTF8 encoding is not active).

+  Vim arguments:
   +  'vim -H file' starts editing a Hebrew file, i.e. 'rightleft' and 'hkmap'
      are set.

+  Keyboard:
   +  The 'allowrevins' option enables the CTRL-_ command in Insert mode and
      in Command-line mode.

   +  CTRL-_ in insert/replace modes toggles 'revins' and 'hkmap' as follows:

      When in rightleft window, 'revins' and 'nohkmap' are toggled, since
      English will likely be inserted in this case.

      When in norightleft window, 'revins' 'hkmap' are toggled, since Hebrew
      will likely be inserted in this case.

      CTRL-_ moves the cursor to the end of the typed text.

   +  CTRL-_ in command mode only toggles keyboard mapping (see Bugs below).
      This setting is independent of 'hkmap' option, which only applies to
      insert/replace mode.

      Note: On some keyboards, CTRL-_ is mapped to CTRL-?.

   +  Keyboard mapping while 'hkmap' is set (standard Israeli keyboard):

	q w e r t y u i o p
	/ '        

	 a s d f g h j k l ; '
	           ,

	  z x c v b n m , . /
	           .

      This is also the keymap when 'keymap=hebrew' is set.  The advantage of
      'keymap' is that it works properly when using UTF8, e.g. it inserts the
      correct characters; 'hkmap' does not.  The 'keymap' keyboard can also
      insert niqud and te`amim.  To see what those mappings are, look at the
      keymap file 'hebrew.vim' etc.


Typing backwards

If the 'revins' (reverse insert) option is set, inserting happens backwards.
This can be used to type Hebrew.  When inserting characters the cursor is not
moved and the text moves rightwards.  A <BS> deletes the character under the
cursor.  CTRL-W and CTRL-U also work in the opposite direction.  <BS>, CTRL-W
and CTRL-U do not stop at the start of insert or end of line, no matter how
the 'backspace' option is set.

There is no reverse replace mode (yet).

If the 'showmode' option is set, "-- REVERSE INSERT --" will be shown in the
status line when reverse Insert mode is active.

When the 'allowrevins' option is set, reverse Insert mode can be also entered
via CTRL-_, which has some extra functionality: First, keyboard mapping is
changed according to the window orientation -- if in a left-to-right window,
'revins' is used to enter Hebrew text, so the keyboard changes to Hebrew
('hkmap' is set); if in a right-to-left window, 'revins' is used to enter
English text, so the keyboard changes to English ('hkmap' is reset).  Second,
when exiting 'revins' via CTRL-_, the cursor moves to the end of the typed
text (if possible).


Pasting when in a rightleft window
----------------------------------
When cutting text with the mouse and pasting it in a rightleft window
the text will be reversed, because the characters come from the cut buffer
from the left to the right, while inserted in the file from the right to
the left.   In order to avoid it, toggle 'revins' (by typing CTRL-? or CTRL-_)
before pasting.


Hebrew characters and the 'isprint' variable
--------------------------------------------
Sometimes Hebrew character codes are in the non-printable range defined by
the 'isprint' variable.  For example in the Linux console, the Hebrew font
encoding starts from 128, while the default 'isprint' variable is @,161-255.
The result is that all Hebrew characters are displayed as ~x.  To solve this
problem, set isprint=@,128-255.

Russian language localization and support in Vim	   *russian* *Russian*

1. Introduction				  |russian-intro|
2. Russian keymaps			  |russian-keymap|
3. Localization				  |russian-l18n|
4. Known issues				  |russian-issues|

===============================================================================
1. Introduction							*russian-intro*

Russian language is supported perfectly well in Vim.  You can type and view
Russian text just as any other, without the need to tweak the settings.

===============================================================================
2. Russian keymaps					       *russian-keymap*

To switch between languages you can use your system native keyboard switcher,
or use one of the Russian keymaps, included in the Vim distribution.  For
example,
>
    :set keymap=russian-jcukenwin
<
In the latter case, you can switch between languages even if you do not have
system Russian keyboard or independently from a system-wide keyboard settings.
See 'keymap'.  You can also map a key to switch between keyboards, if you
choose the latter option.  See |:map|.

For your convenience, to avoid switching between keyboards, when you need to
enter Normal mode command, you can also set 'langmap' option:
>
    :set langmap=;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,
    ;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

This is in utf-8, you cannot read this if your 'encoding' is not utf-8.
You have to type this command in one line, it is wrapped for the sake of
readability.

===============================================================================
3. Localization							 *russian-l18n*

If you wish to use messages, help files, menus and other items translated to
Russian, you will need to install the RuVim Language Pack, available in
different codepages from

    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ruvim/

Make sure that your Vim is at least 6.2.506 and use ruvim 0.5 or later for
automatic installs.  Vim also needs to be compiled with |+gettext| feature for
user interface items translations to work.

After downloading an archive from RuVim project, unpack it into your
$VIMRUNTIME directory.  We recommend using UTF-8 archive, if your version of
Vim is compiled with |+multi_byte| feature enabled.

In order to use the Russian documentation, make sure you have set the
'helplang' option to "ru".

===============================================================================
4. Known issues						       *russian-issues*

-- If you are using Russian message translations in Win32 console, then
   you may see the output produced by "vim --help", "vim --version" commands
   and Win32 console window title appearing in a wrong codepage.  This problem
   is related to a bug in GNU gettext library and may be fixed in the future
   releases of gettext.

    5.4 Constants				|ft-ada-constants|
    5.5 Functions				|ft-ada-functions|
6.  Extra Plug-ins			    |ada-extra-plugins|

==============================================================================
1. Syntax Highlighting ~
							       *ft-ada-syntax*

This mode is designed for the 2005 edition of Ada ("Ada 2005"), which includes
support for objected-programming, protected types, and so on.  It handles code
written for the original Ada language ("Ada83", "Ada87", "Ada95") as well,
though code which uses Ada 2005-only keywords will be wrongly colored (such
code should be fixed anyway).  For more information about Ada, see
http://www.adapower.com.

The Ada mode handles a number of situations cleanly.

For example, it knows that the "-" in "-5" is a number, but the same character
in "A-5" is an operator.  Normally, a "with" or "use" clause referencing
another compilation unit is coloured the same way as C's "#include" is coloured.
If you have "Conditional" or "Repeat" groups coloured differently, then "end
if" and "end loop" will be coloured as part of those respective groups.

You can set these to different colours using vim's "highlight" command (e.g.,
to change how loops are displayed, enter the command ":hi Repeat" followed by
the colour specification; on simple terminals the colour specification
ctermfg=White often shows well).

There are several options you can select in this Ada mode. See |ft-ada-options|
for a complete list.

To enable them, assign a value to the option.  For example, to turn one on:
 >
    > let g:ada_standard_types = 1
>
To disable them use ":unlet".  Example:
>
    > unlet g:ada_standard_types

You can just use ":" and type these into the command line to set these
temporarily before loading an Ada file.  You can make these option settings
permanent by adding the "let" command(s), without a colon, to your "~/.vimrc"
file.

Even on a slow (90Mhz) PC this mode works quickly, but if you find the
performance unacceptable, turn on |g:ada_withuse_ordinary|.

Syntax folding instructions (|fold-syntax|) are added when |g:ada_folding| is
set.

==============================================================================
2. File type Plug-in ~
					       *ft-ada-indent* *ft-ada-plugin*

The Ada plug-in provides support for:

 - auto indenting	(|indent.txt|)
 - insert completion	(|i_CTRL-N|)
 - user completion	(|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|)
 - tag searches		(|tagsrch.txt|)
 - Quick Fix		(|quickfix.txt|)
 - backspace handling	(|'backspace'|)
 - comment handling	(|'comments'|, |'commentstring'|)

The plug-in only activates the features of the Ada mode whenever an Ada
file is opened and adds Ada related entries to the main and pop-up menu.

==============================================================================
3. Omni Completion ~
								 *ft-ada-omni*

The Ada omni-completions (|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|) uses tags database created either
by "gnat xref -v" or the "exuberant Ctags (http://ctags.sourceforge.net).  The
complete function will automatically detect which tool was used to create the
tags file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Omni Completion with "gnat xref" ~
								   *gnat-xref*

GNAT XREF uses the compiler internal information (ali-files) to produce the
tags file. This has the advantage to be 100% correct and the option of deep
nested analysis. However the code must compile, the generator is quite
slow and the created tags file contains only the basic Ctags information for
each entry - not enough for some of the more advanced Vim code browser
plug-ins.

NOTE: "gnat xref -v" is very tricky to use as it has almost no diagnostic
       output - If nothing is printed then usually the parameters are wrong.
       Here some important tips:

1)  You need to compile your code first and use the "-aO" option to point to
    your .ali files.
2)  "gnat xref -v ../Include/adacl.ads" won't work - use  the "gnat xref -v
    -aI../Include adacl.ads" instead.
3)  "gnat xref -v -aI../Include *.ad?" won't work - use "cd ../Include" and
    then "gnat xref -v *.ad?"
4)  Project manager support is completely broken - don't even try "gnat xref
    -Padacl.gpr".
5)  Vim is faster when the tags file is sorted - use "sort --unique
    --ignore-case --output=tags tags" .
6)  Remember to insert "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED 2 %sort ui" as first line to mark
    the file assorted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Omni Completion with "ctags"~
								   *ada-ctags*

Exuberant Ctags uses its own multi-language code parser. The parser is quite
fast, produces a lot of extra information (hence the name "Exuberant Ctags")
and can run on files which currently do not compile.

There are also lots of other Vim-tools which use exuberant Ctags.

You will need to install a version of the Exuberant Ctags which has Ada
support patched in. Such a version is available from the GNU Ada Project
(http://gnuada.sourceforge.net).

The Ada parser for Exuberant Ctags is fairly new - don't expect complete
support yet.

==============================================================================
4. Compiler Support ~
								*ada-compiler*

The Ada mode supports more than one Ada compiler and will automatically load the
compiler set in |g:ada_default_compiler| whenever an Ada source is opened. The
provided compiler plug-ins are split into the actual compiler plug-in and a
collection of support functions and variables. This allows the easy
development of specialized compiler plug-ins fine tuned to your development
environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 GNAT ~
							       *compiler-gnat*

GNAT is the only free (beer and speech) Ada compiler available. There are
several versions available which differ in the licence terms used.

The GNAT compiler plug-in will perform a compile on pressing <F7> and then
immediately shows the result. You can set the project file to be used by
setting:
 >
 > call g:gnat.Set_Project_File ('my_project.gpr')

Setting a project file will also create a Vim session (|views-sessions|) so -
like with the GPS - opened files, window positions etc. will be remembered
separately for all projects.

								*gnat_members*
GNAT OBJECT ~

							       *g:gnat.Make()*
g:gnat.Make()
		Calls |g:gnat.Make_Command| and displays the result inside a
               |quickfix| window.

							     *g:gnat.Pretty()*
g:gnat.Pretty()
		Calls |g:gnat.Pretty_Program|

							       *g:gnat.Find()*
g:gnat.Find()
		Calls |g:gnat.Find_Program|

							       *g:gnat.Tags()*
g:gnat.Tags()
		Calls |g:gnat.Tags_Command|

						   *g:gnat.Set_Project_File()*
g:gnat.Set_Project_File([{file}])
		Set gnat project file and load associated session.  An open
		project will be closed and the session written.  If called
		without file name the file selector opens for selection of a
		project file. If called with an empty string then the project
		and associated session are closed.

							 *g:gnat.Project_File*
g:gnat.Project_File	string
		Current project file.

							 *g:gnat.Make_Command*
g:gnat.Make_Command	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Make()| (|'makeprg'|).

						       *g:gnat.Pretty_Program*
g:gnat.Pretty_Program	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Pretty()|

							 *g:gnat.Find_Program*
g:gnat.Find_Program	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Find()|

							 *g:gnat.Tags_Command*
g:gnat.Tags_Command	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Tags()|

							 *g:gnat.Error_Format*
g:gnat.Error_Format	string
		Error format (|'errorformat'|)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Dec Ada ~
					    *compiler-hpada* *compiler-decada*
					*compiler-vaxada* *compiler-compaqada*

Dec Ada (also known by - in chronological order - VAX Ada, Dec Ada, Compaq Ada
and HP Ada) is a fairly dated Ada 83 compiler. Support is basic: <F7> will
compile the current unit.

The Dec Ada compiler expects the package name and not the file name to be
passed as a parameter. The compiler plug-in supports the usual file name
convention to convert the file into a unit name. Both '-' and '__' are allowed
as separators.

							      *decada_members*
DEC ADA OBJECT ~

							     *g:decada.Make()*
g:decada.Make()		function
		Calls |g:decada.Make_Command| and displays the result inside a
		|quickfix| window.

							*g:decada.Unit_Name()*
g:decada.Unit_Name()	function
		Get the Unit name for the current file.

						       *g:decada.Make_Command*
g:decada.Make_Command	string
		External command used for |g:decada.Make()| (|'makeprg'|).

						       *g:decada.Error_Format*

		Highlight lines which are too long. Note: This highlighting
		option is quite CPU intensive.

							 *g:ada_rainbow_color*
g:ada_rainbow_color	  bool (true when exists)
		Use rainbow colours for '(' and ')'. You need the
		rainbow_parenthesis for this to work.

							       *g:ada_folding*
g:ada_folding		  set ('sigpft')
		Use folding for Ada sources.
		    's':    activate syntax folding on load
			'p':    fold packages

			'x':	lone 'exception' folded with line above
		    'i':    activate indent folding on load

		Note: Syntax folding is in an early (unusable) stage and
		      indent or gnat pretty folding is suggested.

		For gnat pretty folding to work the following settings are
		suggested: -cl3 -M79 -c2 -c3 -c4 -A1 -A2 -A3 -A4 -A5

		For indent folding to work the following settings are
		suggested: shiftwidth=3 softtabstop=3

								*g:ada_abbrev*
g:ada_abbrev		  bool (true when exists)
		Add some abbreviations. This feature is more or less superseded
		by the various completion methods.

						      *g:ada_withuse_ordinary*
g:ada_withuse_ordinary	  bool (true when exists)
		Show "with" and "use" as ordinary keywords (when used to

		specially).

							 *g:ada_begin_preproc*
g:ada_begin_preproc	  bool (true when exists)
		Show all begin-like keywords using the colouring of C
		preprocessor commands.

						    *g:ada_omni_with_keywords*

g:ada_extended_tagging	  enum ('jump', 'list')
		use extended tagging, two options are available
		    'jump': use tjump to jump.
		    'list': add tags quick fix list.
		Normal tagging does not support function or operator
		overloading as these features are not available in C and
		tagging was originally developed for C.

						   *g:ada_extended_completion*
g:ada_extended_completion
		Uses extended completion for <C-N> and <C-R> completions
		(|i_CTRL-N|). In this mode the '.' is used as part of the
		identifier so that 'Object.Method' or 'Package.Procedure' are
		completed together.

						       *g:ada_gnat_extensions*
g:ada_gnat_extensions	  bool (true when exists)
		 Support GNAT extensions.

					       *g:ada_with_gnat_project_files*

		 Add gnat project file keywords and Attributes.

						      *g:ada_default_compiler*
g:ada_default_compiler	  string
		set default compiler. Currently supported are 'gnat' and
		'decada'.

An "exists" type is a boolean considered true when the variable is defined and
false when the variable is undefined. The value to which the variable is set
makes no difference.

6. Extra Plugins ~
							   *ada-extra-plugins*

You can optionally install the following extra plug-ins. They work well with
Ada and enhance the ability of the Ada mode:

backup.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1537
	Keeps as many backups as you like so you don't have to.

rainbow_parenthsis.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1561
	Very helpful since Ada uses only '(' and ')'.

nerd_comments.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218
	Excellent commenting and uncommenting support for almost any
	programming language.

matchit.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39
	'%' jumping for any language. The normal '%' jump only works for '{}'
	style languages. The Ada mode will set the needed search patterns.

taglist.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273
	Source code explorer sidebar. There is a patch for Ada available.

The GNU Ada Project distribution (http://gnuada.sourceforge.net) of Vim
contains all of the above.

*ft_sql.txt*	For Vim version 8.0.  Last change: 2013 May 15

by David Fishburn

This is a filetype plugin to work with SQL files.

The Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard which specifies statements
that allow a user to interact with a relational database.  Vim includes
features for navigation, indentation and syntax highlighting.

==============================================================================
1. Navigation					*sql-navigation*

The SQL ftplugin provides a number of options to assist with file
navigation.


1.1 Matchit					*sql-matchit*
-----------
The matchit plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39)
provides many additional features and can be customized for different
languages.  The matchit plugin is configured by defining a local
buffer variable, b:match_words.  Pressing the % key while on various
keywords will move the cursor to its match.  For example, if the cursor
is on an "if", pressing % will cycle between the "else", "elseif" and
"end if" keywords.

The following keywords are supported: >
    if
    elseif | elsif
    else [if]
    end if

    [while condition] loop
	leave
	break
	continue
	exit
    end loop

    for
	leave
	break
	continue
	exit
    end loop

    do
	statements
    doend

    case
    when
    when
    default
    end case

    merge
    when not matched
    when matched

    create[ or replace] procedure|function|event
    returns


1.2 Text Object Motions				*sql-object-motions*
-----------------------
Vim has a number of predefined keys for working with text |object-motions|.
This filetype plugin attempts to translate these keys to maps which make sense
for the SQL language.

The following |Normal| mode and |Visual| mode maps exist (when you edit a SQL
file): >
    ]]		    move forward to the next 'begin'
    [[		    move backwards to the previous 'begin'
    ][		    move forward to the next 'end'
    []		    move backwards to the previous 'end'


1.3 Predefined Object Motions			*sql-predefined-objects*
-----------------------------
Most relational databases support various standard features, tables, indices,
triggers and stored procedures.  Each vendor also has a variety of proprietary
objects.  The next set of maps have been created to help move between these
objects.  Depends on which database vendor you are using, the list of objects
must be configurable.  The filetype plugin attempts to define many of the
standard objects, plus many additional ones.  In order to make this as
flexible as possible, you can override the list of objects from within your
|vimrc| with the following: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_objects = 'function,procedure,event,table,trigger' .
		\ ',schema,service,publication,database,datatype,domain' .
		\ ',index,subscription,synchronization,view,variable'

The following |Normal| mode and |Visual| mode maps have been created which use
the above list: >
    ]}		    move forward to the next 'create <object name>'
    [{		    move backward to the previous 'create <object name>'

Repeatedly pressing ]} will cycle through each of these create statements: >
    create table t1 (
	...
    );

    create procedure p1
    begin
	...
    end;

    create index i1 on t1 (c1);

The default setting for g:ftplugin_sql_objects is: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_objects = 'function,procedure,event,' .
		\ '\\(existing\\\\|global\\s\\+temporary\\s\\+\\)\\\{,1}' .
		\ 'table,trigger' .
		\ ',schema,service,publication,database,datatype,domain' .
		\ ',index,subscription,synchronization,view,variable'

The above will also handle these cases: >
    create table t1 (
	...
    );
    create existing table t2 (
	...
    );
    create global temporary table t3 (
	...
    );

By default, the ftplugin only searches for CREATE statements.  You can also
override this via your |vimrc| with the following: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_statements = 'create,alter'

The filetype plugin defines three types of comments: >
    1.  --
    2.  //
    3.  /*
	 *
	 */

The following |Normal| mode and |Visual| mode maps have been created to work
with comments: >
    ]"		    move forward to the beginning of a comment
    ["		    move forward to the end of a comment



1.4 Macros					   *sql-macros*
----------
Vim's feature to find macro definitions, |'define'|, is supported using this
regular expression: >
    \c\<\(VARIABLE\|DECLARE\|IN\|OUT\|INOUT\)\>

This addresses the following code: >
    CREATE VARIABLE myVar1 INTEGER;

    CREATE PROCEDURE sp_test(
	IN myVar2 INTEGER,
	OUT myVar3 CHAR(30),
	INOUT myVar4 NUMERIC(20,0)
    )
    BEGIN
	DECLARE myVar5 INTEGER;

	SELECT c1, c2, c3
	  INTO myVar2, myVar3, myVar4
	  FROM T1
	 WHERE c4 = myVar1;
    END;

Place your cursor on "myVar1" on this line: >
	 WHERE c4 = myVar1;
		     ^

Press any of the following keys: >
    [d
    [D
    [CTRL-D


==============================================================================
2. SQL Dialects					*sql-dialects* *sql-types*
						*sybase* *TSQL* *Transact-SQL*
						*sqlanywhere*
						*oracle* *plsql* *sqlj*
						*sqlserver*
						*mysql* *postgresql* *psql*
						*informix*

All relational databases support SQL.  There is a portion of SQL that is
portable across vendors (ex. CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX), but there is a
great deal of vendor specific extensions to SQL.  Oracle supports the
"CREATE OR REPLACE" syntax, column defaults specified in the CREATE TABLE
statement and the procedural language (for stored procedures and triggers).

The default Vim distribution ships with syntax highlighting based on Oracle's
PL/SQL.  The default SQL indent script works for Oracle and SQL Anywhere.
The default filetype plugin works for all vendors and should remain vendor
neutral, but extendable.

Vim currently has support for a variety of different vendors, currently this
is via syntax scripts. Unfortunately, to flip between different syntax rules
you must either create:
    1.  New filetypes
    2.  Custom autocmds
    3.  Manual steps / commands

The majority of people work with only one vendor's database product, it would
be nice to specify a default in your |vimrc|.


2.1 SQLSetType					*sqlsettype* *SQLSetType*
--------------
For the people that work with many different databases, it is nice to be
able to flip between the various vendors rules (indent, syntax) on a per
buffer basis, at any time.  The ftplugin/sql.vim file defines this function: >
    SQLSetType

Executing this function without any parameters will set the indent and syntax
scripts back to their defaults, see |sql-type-default|.  If you have turned
off Vi's compatibility mode, |'compatible'|, you can use the <Tab> key to
complete the optional parameter.

After typing the function name and a space, you can use the completion to
supply a parameter.  The function takes the name of the Vim script you want to
source.  Using the |cmdline-completion| feature, the SQLSetType function will
search the |'runtimepath'| for all Vim scripts with a name containing 'sql'.
This takes the guess work out of the spelling of the names.  The following are
examples: >
    :SQLSetType
    :SQLSetType sqloracle
    :SQLSetType sqlanywhere
    :SQLSetType sqlinformix
    :SQLSetType mysql

The easiest approach is to the use <Tab> character which will first complete
the command name (SQLSetType), after a space and another <Tab>, display a list
of available Vim script names: >
    :SQL<Tab><space><Tab>


2.2 SQLGetType					*sqlgettype* *SQLGetType*
--------------
At anytime you can determine which SQL dialect you are using by calling the
SQLGetType command.  The ftplugin/sql.vim file defines this function: >
    SQLGetType

This will echo: >
    Current SQL dialect in use:sqlanywhere


2.3 SQL Dialect Default				*sql-type-default*
-----------------------
As mentioned earlier, the default syntax rules for Vim is based on Oracle
(PL/SQL).  You can override this default by placing one of the following in
your |vimrc|: >
    let g:sql_type_default = 'sqlanywhere'
    let g:sql_type_default = 'sqlinformix'
    let g:sql_type_default = 'mysql'

If you added the following to your |vimrc|: >
    let g:sql_type_default = 'sqlinformix'

The next time edit a SQL file the following scripts will be automatically
loaded by Vim: >
    ftplugin/sql.vim
    syntax/sqlinformix.vim
    indent/sql.vim
>
Notice indent/sqlinformix.sql was not loaded.  There is no indent file
for Informix, Vim loads the default files if the specified files does not
exist.


==============================================================================
3. Adding new SQL Dialects			*sql-adding-dialects*

If you begin working with a SQL dialect which does not have any customizations
available with the default Vim distribution you can check http://www.vim.org
to see if any customization currently exist.  If not, you can begin by cloning
an existing script.  Read |filetype-plugins| for more details.

To help identify these scripts, try to create the files with a "sql" prefix.
If you decide you wish to create customizations for the SQLite database, you
can create any of the following: >
    Unix
	~/.vim/syntax/sqlite.vim
	~/.vim/indent/sqlite.vim
    Windows
	$VIM/vimfiles/syntax/sqlite.vim
	$VIM/vimfiles/indent/sqlite.vim

No changes are necessary to the SQLSetType function.  It will automatically
pickup the new SQL files and load them when you issue the SQLSetType command.


==============================================================================
4. OMNI SQL Completion				*sql-completion*
						*omni-sql-completion*

Vim 7 includes a code completion interface and functions which allows plugin
developers to build in code completion for any language.  Vim 7 includes
code completion for the SQL language.

There are two modes to the SQL completion plugin, static and dynamic.  The
static mode populates the popups with the data generated from current syntax
highlight rules.  The dynamic mode populates the popups with data retrieved
directly from a database.  This includes, table lists, column lists,
procedures names and more.

4.1 Static Mode					*sql-completion-static*
---------------
The static popups created contain items defined by the active syntax rules
while editing a file with a filetype of SQL.  The plugin defines (by default)
various maps to help the user refine the list of items to be displayed.
The defaults static maps are: >
    imap <buffer> <C-C>a <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('syntax')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>k <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlKeyword')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>f <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlFunction')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>o <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlOption')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>T <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlType')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>s <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlStatement')<CR><C-X><C-O>

The use of "<C-C>" can be user chosen by using the following in your |.vimrc| as it 
may not work properly on all platforms: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_omni_key = '<C-C>'
>
The static maps (which are based on the syntax highlight groups) follow this
format: >
    imap <buffer> <C-C>k <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlKeyword')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>k <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlKeyword\w*')<CR><C-X><C-O>

This command breaks down as: >
    imap		   - Create an insert map
    <buffer>		   - Only for this buffer
    <C-C>k		   - Your choice of key map
    <C-\><C-O>		   - Execute one command, return to Insert mode
    :call sqlcomplete#Map( - Allows the SQL completion plugin to perform some
			     housekeeping functions to allow it to be used in
			     conjunction with other completion plugins.
			     Indicate which item you want the SQL completion
			     plugin to complete.
			     In this case we are asking the plugin to display
			     items from the syntax highlight group
			     'sqlKeyword'.
			     You can view a list of highlight group names to
			     choose from by executing the
				 :syntax list
			     command while editing a SQL file.
    'sqlKeyword'	   - Display the items for the sqlKeyword highlight
			     group
    'sqlKeyword\w*'	   - A second option available with Vim 7.4 which
                             uses a regular expression to determine which
			     syntax groups to use
    )<CR>		   - Execute the :let command
    <C-X><C-O>		   - Trigger the standard omni completion key stroke.
			     Passing in 'sqlKeyword' instructs the SQL
			     completion plugin to populate the popup with
			     items from the sqlKeyword highlight group.  The
			     plugin will also cache this result until Vim is
			     restarted.  The syntax list is retrieved using
			     the syntaxcomplete plugin.

Using the 'syntax' keyword is a special case.  This instructs the
syntaxcomplete plugin to retrieve all syntax items.  So this will effectively
work for any of Vim's SQL syntax files.  At the time of writing this includes
10 different syntax files for the different dialects of SQL (see section 3
above, |sql-dialects|).

Here are some examples of the entries which are pulled from the syntax files: >
     All
	 - Contains the contents of all syntax highlight groups
     Statements
	 - Select, Insert, Update, Delete, Create, Alter, ...
     Functions
	 - Min, Max, Trim, Round, Date, ...
     Keywords
	 - Index, Database, Having, Group, With
     Options
	 - Isolation_level, On_error, Qualify_owners, Fire_triggers, ...
     Types
	 - Integer, Char, Varchar, Date, DateTime, Timestamp, ...


4.2 Dynamic Mode				*sql-completion-dynamic*
----------------
Dynamic mode populates the popups with data directly from a database.  In
order for the dynamic feature to be enabled you must have the dbext.vim
plugin installed, (http://vim.sourceforge.net/script.php?script_id=356).

Dynamic mode is used by several features of the SQL completion plugin.
After installing the dbext plugin see the dbext-tutorial for additional
configuration and usage.  The dbext plugin allows the SQL completion plugin
to display a list of tables, procedures, views and columns. >
     Table List
	 - All tables for all schema owners
     Procedure List
	 - All stored procedures for all schema owners
     View List
	 - All stored procedures for all schema owners
     Column List
	 - For the selected table, the columns that are part of the table

To enable the popup, while in INSERT mode, use the following key combinations
for each group (where <C-C> means hold the CTRL key down while pressing
the space bar):
     Table List		   - <C-C>t
			   - <C-X><C-O> (the default map assumes tables)
     Stored Procedure List - <C-C>p
     View List		   - <C-C>v
     Column List	   - <C-C>c

     Drilling In / Out     - When viewing a popup window displaying the list
			     of tables, you can press <Right>, this will
			     replace the table currently highlighted with
			     the column list for that table.
			   - When viewing a popup window displaying the list
			     of columns, you can press <Left>, this will
			     replace the column list with the list of tables.
			   - This allows you to quickly drill down into a
			     table to view its columns and back again.
			   - <Right> and <Left> can be also be chosen via
			     your |.vimrc| >
                                let g:ftplugin_sql_omni_key_right = '<Right>'
                                let g:ftplugin_sql_omni_key_left  = '<Left>'

The SQL completion plugin caches various lists that are displayed in
the popup window.  This makes the re-displaying of these lists very
fast.  If new tables or columns are added to the database it may become
necessary to clear the plugins cache.  The default map for this is: >
    imap <buffer> <C-C>R <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('ResetCache')<CR><C-X><C-O>


4.3 SQL Tutorial				*sql-completion-tutorial*
----------------

This tutorial is designed to take you through the common features of the SQL
completion plugin so that: >
     a) You gain familiarity with the plugin
     b) You are introduced to some of the more common features
     c) Show how to customize it to your preferences
     d) Demonstrate "Best of Use" of the plugin (easiest way to configure).

First, create a new buffer: >
     :e tutorial.sql


Static features
---------------
To take you through the various lists, simply enter insert mode, hit:
    <C-C>s   (show SQL statements)
At this point, you can page down through the list until you find "select".
If you are familiar with the item you are looking for, for example you know
the statement begins with the letter "s".  You can type ahead (without the
quotes) "se" then press:
    <C-Space>t
Assuming "select" is highlighted in the popup list press <Enter> to choose
the entry.  Now type:
    * fr<C-C>a (show all syntax items)
choose "from" from the popup list.

When writing stored procedures using the "type" list is useful.  It contains
a list of all the database supported types.  This may or may not be true
depending on the syntax file you are using.  The SQL Anywhere syntax file
(sqlanywhere.vim) has support for this: >
     BEGIN
	DECLARE customer_id <C-C>T <-- Choose a type from the list


Dynamic features
----------------
To take advantage of the dynamic features you must first install the
dbext.vim plugin (http://vim.sourceforge.net/script.php?script_id=356).  It
also comes with a tutorial.  From the SQL completion plugin's perspective,
the main feature dbext provides is a connection to a database.  dbext
connection profiles are the most efficient mechanism to define connection
information.  Once connections have been setup, the SQL completion plugin
uses the features of dbext in the background to populate the popups.

What follows assumes dbext.vim has been correctly configured, a simple test
is to run the command, :DBListTable.  If a list of tables is shown, you know
dbext.vim is working as expected.  If not, please consult the dbext.txt
documentation.

Assuming you have followed the dbext-tutorial you can press <C-C>t to
display a list of tables.  There is a delay while dbext is creating the table
list.  After the list is displayed press <C-W>.  This will remove both the
popup window and the table name already chosen when the list became active. >

 4.3.1 Table Completion:			*sql-completion-tables*

Press <C-C>t to display a list of tables from within the database you
have connected via the dbext plugin.
NOTE: All of the SQL completion popups support typing a prefix before pressing
the key map.  This will limit the contents of the popup window to just items
beginning with those characters.  >

 4.3.2 Column Completion:			*sql-completion-columns*

The SQL completion plugin can also display a list of columns for particular
tables.  The column completion is trigger via <C-C>c.

NOTE: The following example uses <Right> to trigger a column list while
      the popup window is active.  

Example of using column completion:
     - Press <C-C>t again to display the list of tables.
     - When the list is displayed in the completion window, press <Right>,
       this will replace the list of tables, with a list of columns for the
       table highlighted (after the same short delay).
     - If you press <Left>, this will again replace the column list with the
       list of tables.  This allows you to drill into tables and column lists
       very quickly.
     - Press <Right> again while the same table is highlighted.  You will
       notice there is no delay since the column list has been cached.  If you
       change the schema of a cached table you can press <C-C>R, which
       clears the SQL completion cache.
     - NOTE: <Right> and <Left> have been designed to work while the
       completion window is active.  If the completion popup window is
       not active, a normal <Right> or <Left> will be executed.

Let's look at how we can build a SQL statement dynamically.  A select statement
requires a list of columns.  There are two ways to build a column list using
the SQL completion plugin. >
    One column at a time:
<       1. After typing SELECT press <C-C>t to display a list of tables.
	2. Choose a table from the list.
	3. Press <Right> to display a list of columns.
	4. Choose the column from the list and press enter.
	5. Enter a "," and press <C-C>c.  Generating a column list
	   generally requires having the cursor on a table name.  The plugin
	   uses this name to determine what table to retrieve the column list.
	   In this step, since we are pressing <C-C>c without the cursor
	   on a table name the column list displayed will be for the previous
	   table.  Choose a different column and move on.
	6. Repeat step 5 as often as necessary. >
    All columns for a table:
<	1. After typing SELECT press <C-C>t to display a list of tables.
	2. Highlight the table you need the column list for.
	3. Press <Enter> to choose the table from the list.
	4. Press <C-C>l to request a comma separated list of all columns
	   for this table.
	5. Based on the table name chosen in step 3, the plugin attempts to
	   decide on a reasonable table alias.	You are then prompted to
	   either accept of change the alias.  Press OK.
	6. The table name is replaced with the column list of the table is
	   replaced with the comma separate list of columns with the alias
	   prepended to each of the columns.
	7. Step 3 and 4 can be replaced by pressing <C-C>L, which has
	   a <C-Y> embedded in the map to choose the currently highlighted
	   table in the list.

There is a special provision when writing select statements.  Consider the
following statement: >
     select *
       from customer c,
	    contact cn,
	    department as dp,
	    employee e,
	    site_options so
      where c.

In INSERT mode after typing the final "c." which is an alias for the
"customer" table, you can press either <C-C>c or <C-X><C-O>.  This will
popup a list of columns for the customer table.  It does this by looking back
to the beginning of the select statement and finding a list of the tables
specified in the FROM clause.  In this case it notes that in the string
"customer c", "c" is an alias for the customer table.  The optional "AS"
keyword is also supported, "customer AS c". >


 4.3.3 Procedure Completion:			*sql-completion-procedures*

Similar to the table list, <C-C>p, will display a list of stored
procedures stored within the database. >

 4.3.4 View Completion:				*sql-completion-views*

Similar to the table list, <C-C>v, will display a list of views in the
database.


4.4 Completion Customization			*sql-completion-customization*
----------------------------

The SQL completion plugin can be customized through various options set in
your |vimrc|: >
    omni_sql_no_default_maps
<       - Default: This variable is not defined
	- If this variable is defined, no maps are created for OMNI
	  completion.  See |sql-completion-maps| for further discussion.
>
    omni_sql_use_tbl_alias
<	- Default: a
	- This setting is only used when generating a comma separated
	  column list.	By default the map is <C-C>l.  When generating
	  a column list, an alias can be prepended to the beginning of each
	  column, for example:	e.emp_id, e.emp_name.  This option has three
	  settings: >
		n - do not use an alias
		d - use the default (calculated) alias
		a - ask to confirm the alias name
<
	  An alias is determined following a few rules:
	       1.  If the table name has an '_', then use it as a separator: >
		   MY_TABLE_NAME --> MTN
		   my_table_name --> mtn
		   My_table_NAME --> MtN
<	       2.  If the table name does NOT contain an '_', but DOES use
		   mixed case then the case is used as a separator: >
		   MyTableName --> MTN
<	       3.  If the table name does NOT contain an '_', and does NOT
		   use mixed case then the first letter of the table is used: >
		   mytablename --> m
		   MYTABLENAME --> M

    omni_sql_ignorecase
<	- Default: Current setting for 'ignorecase'
	- Valid settings are 0 or 1.
	- When entering a few letters before initiating completion, the list
	  will be filtered to display only the entries which begin with the
	  list of characters.  When this option is set to 0, the list will be
	  filtered using case sensitivity. >

    omni_sql_include_owner
<	- Default: 0, unless dbext.vim 3.00 has been installed
	- Valid settings are 0 or 1.
	- When completing tables, procedure or views and using dbext.vim 3.00
	  or higher the list of objects will also include the owner name.
	  When completing these objects and omni_sql_include_owner is enabled
	  the owner name will be replaced. >

    omni_sql_precache_syntax_groups
<	- Default:
	  ['syntax','sqlKeyword','sqlFunction','sqlOption','sqlType','sqlStatement']
	- sqlcomplete can be used in conjunction with other completion
	  plugins.  This is outlined at |sql-completion-filetypes|.  When the
	  filetype is changed temporarily to SQL, the sqlcompletion plugin
	  will cache the syntax groups listed in the List specified in this
	  option.

4.5 SQL Maps					*sql-completion-maps*
------------

The default SQL maps have been described in other sections of this document in
greater detail.  Here is a list of the maps with a brief description of each.

Static Maps
-----------
These are maps which use populate the completion list using Vim's syntax
highlighting rules. >
    <C-C>a
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items. >
    <C-C>k
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlKeyword'. >
    <C-C>f
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlFunction. >
    <C-C>o
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlOption'. >
    <C-C>T
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlType'. >
    <C-C>s
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlStatement'. >

Dynamic Maps
------------
These are maps which use populate the completion list using the dbext.vim
plugin. >
    <C-C>t
<       - Displays a list of tables. >
    <C-C>p
<       - Displays a list of procedures. >
    <C-C>v
<       - Displays a list of views. >
    <C-C>c
<       - Displays a list of columns for a specific table. >
    <C-C>l
<       - Displays a comma separated list of columns for a specific table. >
    <C-C>L
<       - Displays a comma separated list of columns for a specific table.
	  This should only be used when the completion window is active. >
    <Right>
<	- Displays a list of columns for the table currently highlighted in
	  the completion window.  <Right> is not recognized on most Unix
	  systems, so this maps is only created on the Windows platform.
	  If you would like the same feature on Unix, choose a different key
	  and make the same map in your vimrc. >
    <Left>
<	- Displays the list of tables.
	  <Left> is not recognized on most Unix systems, so this maps is
	  only created on the Windows platform.  If you would like the same
	  feature on Unix, choose a different key and make the same map in
	  your vimrc. >
    <C-C>R
<	- This maps removes all cached items and forces the SQL completion
	  to regenerate the list of items.

Customizing Maps
----------------
You can create as many additional key maps as you like.  Generally, the maps
will be specifying different syntax highlight groups.

If you do not wish the default maps created or the key choices do not work on
your platform (often a case on *nix) you define the following variable in
your |vimrc|: >
    let g:omni_sql_no_default_maps = 1

Do no edit ftplugin/sql.vim directly!  If you change this file your changes
will be over written on future updates.  Vim has a special directory structure
which allows you to make customizations without changing the files that are
included with the Vim distribution.  If you wish to customize the maps
create an after/ftplugin/sql.vim (see |after-directory|) and place the same
maps from the ftplugin/sql.vim in it using your own key strokes.  <C-C> was
chosen since it will work on both Windows and *nix platforms.  On the windows
platform you can also use <C-Space> or ALT keys.


4.6 Using with other filetypes			*sql-completion-filetypes*
------------------------------

Many times SQL can be used with different filetypes.  For example Perl, Java,
PHP, Javascript can all interact with a database.  Often you need both the SQL
completion and the completion capabilities for the current language you are
editing.

This can be enabled easily with the following steps (assuming a Perl file): >
    1.  :e test.pl
    2.  :set filetype=sql
    3.  :set ft=perl

Step 1
------
Begins by editing a Perl file.  Vim automatically sets the filetype to
"perl".  By default, Vim runs the appropriate filetype file
ftplugin/perl.vim.  If you are using the syntax completion plugin by following
the directions at |ft-syntax-omni| then the |'omnifunc'| option has been set to
"syntax#Complete".  Pressing <C-X><C-O> will display the omni popup containing
the syntax items for Perl.

Step 2
------
Manually setting the filetype to 'sql' will also fire the appropriate filetype
files ftplugin/sql.vim.  This file will define a number of buffer specific
maps for SQL completion, see |sql-completion-maps|.  Now these maps have
been created and the SQL completion plugin has been initialized.  All SQL
syntax items have been cached in preparation.  The SQL filetype script detects
we are attempting to use two different completion plugins.  Since the SQL maps
begin with <C-C>, the maps will toggle the |'omnifunc'| when in use.  So you
can use <C-X><C-O> to continue using the completion for Perl (using the syntax
completion plugin) and <C-C> to use the SQL completion features.

Step 3
------
Setting the filetype back to Perl sets all the usual "perl" related items back
as they were.

*hangulin.txt*  For Vim version 8.0.  Last change: 2015 Nov 24


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Chi-Deok Hwang and Sung-Hyun Nam


Introduction					*hangul*
------------
It is to input hangul, the Korean language, with Vim GUI version.
If you have a XIM program, you can use another |+xim| feature.
Basically, it is for anybody who has no XIM program.

Compile
-------
Next is a basic option.  You can add any other configure option. >

   ./configure --with-x --enable-multibyte --enable-hangulinput \
            --disable-xim

And you should check feature.h.  If |+hangul_input| feature is enabled
by configure, you can select more options such as keyboard type, 2 bulsik
or 3 bulsik.  You can find keywords like next in there. >

	#define HANGUL_DEFAULT_KEYBOARD 2
	#define ESC_CHG_TO_ENG_MODE
	/* #define X_LOCALE */

Environment variables
---------------------
You should set LANG variable to Korean locale such as ko, ko_KR.eucKR
or ko_KR.UTF-8.
If you set LC_ALL variable, it should be set to Korean locale also.

Vim resource
------------
You may want to set 'encoding' and 'fileencodings'.
Next are examples: >

	:set encoding=euc-kr
	:set encoding=utf-8
	:set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,cp949,euc-kr,latin1

Keyboard
--------
You can change keyboard type (2 bulsik or 3 bulsik) using VIM_KEYBOARD
or HANGUL_KEYBOARD_TYPE environment variables.  For sh, just do (2 bulsik): >

    export VIM_KEYBOARD="2"
or >
    export HANGUL_KEYBOARD_TYPE="2"

If both are set, VIM_KEYBOARD has higher priority.

Hangul Fonts
------------
If you use GTK version of gvim, you should set 'guifont' and 'guifontwide'.
For example: >
    set guifont=Courier\ 12
    set guifontwide=NanumGothicCoding\ 12

If you use Motif or Athena version of gvim, you should set 'guifontset' in
your vimrc.  You can set fontset in the .Xdefaults file.

$HOME/.gvimrc: >
    set guifontset=english_font,hangul_font

$HOME/.Xdefaults: >
    Vim.font: english_font

    ! Nexts are for hangul menu with Athena
    *international: True
    Vim*fontSet: english_font,hangul_font

    ! Nexts are for hangul menu with Motif
    *international: True
    Vim*fontList: english_font;hangul_font:

attention! the , (comma) or ; (semicolon)

And there should be no ':set guifont'.  If it exists, then gvim ignores
':set guifontset'.  It means Vim runs without fontset supporting.
So, you can see only English.  Hangul does not be correctly displayed.

After "fontset" feature is enabled, Vim does not allow using english
font only in "font" setting for syntax.
For example, if you use >
   :set guifontset=eng_font,your_font
in your .gvimrc, then you should do for syntax >
   :hi Comment guifg=Cyan font=another_eng_font,another_your_font
If you just do >
   :hi Comment font=another_eng_font
then you can see a error message.  Be careful!

hangul_font width should be twice than english_font width.

Unsupported Feature
-------------------
We don't support Johab font.
We don't support Hanja input.
And We don't have any plan to support them.

If you really need such features, you can use console version of Vim with a
capable terminal emulator.

*rileft.txt*    For Vim version 8.0.  Last change: 2006 Apr 24


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Avner Lottem
					  updated by Nadim Shaikli


Right to Left display mode for Vim				*rileft*


These functions were originally created by Avner Lottem:
   E-mail: alottem@iil.intel.com
   Phone:  +972-4-8307322

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

								*E26*
{only available when compiled with the |+rightleft| feature}


Introduction
------------
Some languages such as Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew (among others) require the
ability to display their text from right-to-left.  Files in those languages
are stored conventionally and the right-to-left requirement is only a
function of the display engine (per the Unicode specification).  In
right-to-left oriented files the characters appear on the screen from
right to left.

Bidirectionality (or bidi for short) is what Unicode offers as a full
solution to these languages.  Bidi offers the user the ability to view
both right-to-left as well as left-to-right text properly at the same time
within the same window.  Vim currently, due to simplicity, does not offer
bidi and is merely opting to present a functional means to display/enter/use
right-to-left languages.  An older hybrid solution in which direction is
encoded for every character (or group of characters) are not supported either
as this kind of support is out of the scope of a simple addition to an
existing editor (and it's not sanctioned by Unicode either).


Highlights
----------
o  Editing left-to-right files as in the original Vim, no change.

o  Viewing and editing files in right-to-left windows.  File orientation
   is per window, so it is possible to view the same file in right-to-left
   and left-to-right modes, simultaneously.  (Useful for editing mixed files
   in which both right-to-left and left-to-right text exist).

o  Compatibility to the original Vim.  Almost all features work in
   right-to-left mode (see Bugs below).

o  Backing from reverse insert mode to the correct place in the file
   (if possible).

o  No special terminal with right-to-left capabilities is required.  The
   right-to-left changes are completely hardware independent.

o  Many languages use and require right-to-left support.  These languages
   can quite easily be supported given the inclusion of their required
   keyboard mappings and some possible minor code change.  Some of the
   current supported languages include - |arabic.txt|, |farsi.txt| and
   |hebrew.txt|.


Of Interest...
--------------

o  Invocations
   -----------
   + 'rightleft' ('rl') sets window orientation to right-to-left.
   + 'delcombine' ('deco'), boolean, if editing UTF-8 encoded languages,
     allows one to remove a composing character which gets superimposed
     on those that proceeded them (some languages require this).
   + 'rightleftcmd' ('rlc') sets the command-line within certain modes
     (such as search) to be utilized in right-to-left orientation as well.

o  Typing backwards					*ins-reverse*
   ----------------
   In lieu of using full-fledged the 'rightleft' option, one can opt for
   reverse insertion.  When the 'revins' (reverse insert) option is set,
   inserting happens backwards.  This can be used to type right-to-left
   text.  When inserting characters the cursor is not moved and the text
   moves rightwards.  A <BS> deletes the character under the cursor.
   CTRL-W and CTRL-U also work in the opposite direction.  <BS>, CTRL-W
   and CTRL-U do not stop at the start of insert or end of line, no matter
   how the 'backspace' option is set.

   There is no reverse replace mode (yet).

   If the 'showmode' option is set, "-- REVERSE INSERT --" will be shown
   in the status line when reverse Insert mode is active.

o  Pasting when in a rightleft window
   ----------------------------------
   When cutting text with the mouse and pasting it in a rightleft window
   the text will be reversed, because the characters come from the cut buffer
   from the left to the right, while inserted in the file from the right to
   the left.   In order to avoid it, toggle 'revins' before pasting.


Bugs
----
o  Does not handle CTRL-A and CTRL-X commands (add and subtract) correctly
   when in rightleft window.

o  Does not support reverse insert and rightleft modes on the command-line.
   However, functionality of the editor is not reduced, because it is
   possible to enter mappings, abbreviations and searches typed from the
   left to the right on the command-line.

o  Somewhat slower in right-to-left mode, because right-to-left motion is
   emulated inside Vim, not by the controlling terminal.

o  When the Athena GUI is used, the bottom scrollbar works in the wrong
   direction.  This is difficult to fix.

o  When both 'rightleft' and 'revins' are on: 'textwidth' does not work.
   Lines do not wrap at all; you just get a single, long line.

o  There is no full bidirectionality (bidi) support.
